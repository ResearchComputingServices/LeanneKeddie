0.37755007^0.66404736^This EBITDA margin objective represented 20% of the total target annual bonus amount, with potential payouts ranging from 0% to 40% of the total target bonus amount based on actual performance.
0.37747842^0.6643707^Based on specific targets set at the beginning of the 2014 annual bonus performance cycle, we achieved an EBITDA margin of 41.8% in 2014, representing an increase from 37.0% EBITDA margin in 2013.
0.29632732^0.7824704^The financial half of the annual cash incentive opportunity for all executive officers had, prior to 2013, been based solely on EPS.
0.2876758^0.753923^In July 2013, the Compensation Committee approved the inclusion of a relative performance incentive ( RPI ) component to the financial half of the annual cash incentive, and the Compensation Committee maintained this approach for 2014.
0.15660624^0.7726238^As a result, the financial half of the NEOs  2014 annual cash incentive was based equally on (i) achievement of EPS targets and (ii) achievement of relative financial performance criteria.
0.3741462^0.6946917^The process used to set annual EPS targets starts with a review of plans and projections following bottom-up planning from the field, which considers factors such as:
0.3709925^0.69397277^The Compensation Committee approved the following EPS performance targets and corresponding payouts at its January 2014 meeting, for purposes of the 2014 annual cash incentive:
0.37208617^0.69378316^The Compensation Committee selected EPS as an absolute measure upon which to base half of the financial portion of the annual cash incentive because it is the primary absolute basis on which we set our performance expectations for the year.
0.2863697^0.7502736^The RPI component of the annual cash incentive is based on our one-year performance in each of our four geographic areas as compared against the performance of Halliburton and Baker Hughes in their corresponding geographic areas, measured by:
0.4066231^0.7166363^revenue growth (% change), and
0.40099946^0.7011589^pretax operating margin growth (basis points).
0.28533787^0.75452745^The Committee believes that the RPI cash incentive component:
0.35254782^0.7269241^The performance of our RPI comparator companies for purposes of calculating relative performance is derived from their reported company results.
0.15643969^0.77600336^The RPI payout, if any, to our NEOs is based on the sum of our overall rankings achieved in each of our four geographic areas worldwide, comparing year-over-year revenue growth and margin improvement in each geographic area against that of our two RPI comparator companies.
0.37818828^0.6917913^Schlumberger s 2014 EPS was $5.57, while reported EPS was $4.31, which included $1.26 of charges attributable to the WesternGeco restructuring, currency devaluation loss in Venezuela, workforce reduction and an impairment of an SPM project.
0.34938017^0.69424975^As a result, the Compensation Committee approved a payout of 142.5% of the EPS component of the annual cash incentive.
0.3296324^0.695374^According to the RPI Performance Payout Matrix above, we achieved an RPI result in 2014 of 7, corresponding to a total RPI payout of 100%, out of a possible 250% total RPI payout.
0.3328114^0.7014516^Accordingly, the Committee decided to use its discretion and approved a total RPI payout of 135%, out of a possible 250%.

0.39345005^0.70453775^While we track many operational and strategic performance goals throughout the year, operating margin and revenue together are considered a key measure of our success in achieving profitable growth and were selected for fiscal year 2015 to continue to align payouts under the EOPB with the Company's profitability year over year.
0.37438592^0.7601776^The assessment of individual performance takes into account a number of quantitative and qualitative factors such as attainment of key strategic goals and objectives, specific revenue and earnings goals for each business, successful acquisitions/divestitures and integration efforts, as well as the financial performance and overall company performance as described in the Executive Summary.
0.22152758^0.8093355^We did not achieve our threshold GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income goals, and therefore each named executive officer received no payout for 70% of his annual incentive that was allocated to financial goals.
0.37689966^0.6640997^EBIT was selected as the appropriate performance measure since the level of EBIT reflects the operating strength and efficiency of the Company.

0.3430008^0.74128675^These targets were set in February 2014 and the revenue targets were then subject to minor self-executing adjustments (i.e., increases) to reflect our acquisition of Think Big Analytics in September 2014.
0.39132166^0.6909907^Our GAAP revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share goals used in the 2014 annual bonus program and the 2014 performance-based restricted share unit awards tie to our audited financial statements as adjusted and disclosed to investors in our quarterly earnings releases.
0.42276183^0.74370575^Delivered record-level germplasm yield advantage compared to competitor seed, supporting sales share, and implemented significant technology upgrades to advance breeding, testing and seed treatment efficiencies and collaboration
0.40179396^0.7566223^During this period, the Company continued to focus on strengthening its financial position and executed strategies to create and deliver value to its shareholders and to position the Company for long-term success.
0.4083213^0.7717615^Mr. Moonves' leadership, the Company continued to return significant value to shareholders through a 25% increase in its dividend per share in 2014 and through its share repurchase program, and executed its plan to complete the divestiture of its Outdoor Americas business in 2014.
0.40050703^0.76498187^Mr. Ianniello led his team to successfully manage the Company's finances.
0.396224^0.72260594^Under Mr. Ianniello's leadership, the Company was successful in growing its earnings per share over the prior fiscal year and for the fifth consecutive fiscal year.
0.39786902^0.7583021^He focused on strengthening the Company's financial position and returning value to shareholders by successfully managing the Company's stock buyback program; restructuring the Company's debt portfolio to lower its weighted average interest rate; and amending the Company's credit facility to increase capacity and extend its maturity resulting in a full five-year term, giving the Company additional financial flexibility.
0.41546887^0.7428946^He also led improvements in the Company's operations and executed on the Company's strategic transformation objectives by expanding efforts to monetize the Company's premium content, including through the negotiations of key retransmission, station affiliation, streaming and VOD deals, increasing these revenue streams by 27% over the prior year.
0.39828995^0.7627251^Also, throughout 2014, Mr. Ianniello successfully communicated an effective message to the investment community; achieved significant tax savings from strategic tax planning and provided leadership and direction for the Company's information technology group.
0.4005227^0.7266486^Mr. Ambrosio effectively managed the Company's most significant areas of people and administrative costs, including controlling overall compensation and benefit expenses, reducing sourcing spend across the Company's business units (which will result in annualized savings in excess of $20 million) and negotiating key real estate occupancy costs (which resulted in more than $22 million in savings for 2014).
0.37772012^0.6642107^The financial performance measure used to determine a significant portion of each executive s earned award is adjusted EBITDA measured at the global level and, for each of our business units, also as measured at the business unit level.
0.3780488^0.66409117^2014 Adjusted EBITDA Target under the EBP: The Committee uses adjusted EBITDA when establishing financial performance targets under the EBP so that we can effectively tie compensation to our operating results.2 We believe sustained growth in profitability over time significantly correlates to value creation for our stockholders.
0.3786528^0.6631826^For our CEO and other corporate executives who manage our global business, we measure adjusted EBITDA against plan at the global level.
0.37898022^0.663034^For ourbusiness unit executives, we measure adjusted EBITDA against plan at both the business unit and the global level.
0.37702775^0.6678593^Target financial performance under the EBP corresponds to our Board-approved internal financial and operating plan established at the beginning of each performance year, which we believe represents appropriate goal-setting by us.
0.37608874^0.66551715^Following year-end, our actual financial performance is then compared to the targeted financial performance, and a resulting  adjustment factor  is applied to the executive s entire target EBP award.
0.37713414^0.6641394^For our executives to be eligible to receive any award under the EBP in 2014, our actual financial performance had to exceed 70% of the applicable target for adjusted EBITDA (as indicated in the table above).
0.3770723^0.6633575^Performance at the target level for adjusted EBITDA would have resulted in a 100% adjustment factor (i.e., no multiplier or discount applied to the EBP target award), and performance at 130% or greater of the target level for adjusted EBITDA would have resulted in a 200% adjustment factor (i.e.,a 2x multiplier applied to the entire target EBP award).
0.37752384^0.66273284^The adjustment factor for performance between 70% and 130% of the target level for adjusted EBITDA is linearly interpolated.
0.3772458^0.66327536^For example, in 2014 our adjusted EBITDA at the global level was 105.8% of target (resulting in a 119.3% adjustment factor to the portion of a target EBP award subject to global performance), adjusted EBITDA in our Americas business was 108.6% of target (for our CEO Americas, resulting in a 128.7% adjustment factor to the 50% portion of his target EBP award subject to our Americas business performance), and adjusted EBITDA in our Asia Pacific business was 105.9% of target (for our Executive Chairman  Asia Pacific, resulting in a 119.7% adjustment factor to the 50% portion of his target EBP award subject to our Asia Pacific business performance).
0.376269^0.6649656^Once determined, the adjustment factor is applied to the entire target EBP award, and the portion of the resulting product subject to financial performance measures (as noted above, 80% of the 2014 EBP award for all named executive officers) becomes the  financial performance portion  of the total EBP award.

0.1618275^0.772066^These were the same objectives and weightings used for purposes of the 2013 AIP to continue incenting our NEOs to increase sales, improve profitability and generate strong free cash flow.
0.38223273^0.69237375^The Committee selected adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow as the financial measures on which to assess the company s performance for purposes of funding the cash bonus pool.
0.38388032^0.70293766^These three financial metrics (adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow) were deemed appropriate by the Committee as they are of immediate interest to shareholders and are the primary measures as to which Baxter regularly provides guidance to the market.
0.3804238^0.6901433^Adjusted EPS is the most heavily weighted measure, as the Committee believes it is a straightforward measure of the company s current ability to generate value that is well understood by shareholders.
0.30271298^0.7459945^The table also provides target and adjusted operating cash flow for 2014 and 2013, as 2013 was the first year such measure was used for the cash bonus pool.
0.3785538^0.68921584^The company calculated adjusted EPS for purposes of funding the cash bonus pool the same way it calculated adjusted EPS when it publicly announced its results   that is, the special items that were excluded from EPS to arrive at adjusted EPS were the same.
0.4062532^0.7178656^Baxter uses adjusted sales (rather than net sales) as a target for the same reason that Baxter provides sales guidance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations   that is, the company believes it provides a better perspective on underlying sales growth.
0.3032446^0.76346785^Based on the company s performance against its 2014 financial targets, the bonus pool was funded at 1.92 times the base salary for each executive officer covered by the bonus pool (other than Mr. Parkinson, for whom the bonus pool was funded at 1.922 times his target cash bonus).
0.38289317^0.70772135^As discussed above, Baxter performed relative to its adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow financial targets for 2014 at 101.2%, 102.2% and 97.8%, respectively.
0.381004^0.7264151^This adjustment primarily reflects the financial performance of Baxter in 2014 as well as Mr. Hombach s leadership with respect to the company s finance function and within the organization.
0.37475628^0.7011838^The cumulative operating earnings per share score for the 2012-2014 performance units was 112.3 percent of target.
0.31222668^0.67555106^The relative total shareholder return (TSR) measure at the end of the performance period was at the 75th percentile of the S&P 500 Electric Utilities Industry Index, which produced a score of 183.3 percent of target.

0.38010654^0.69762117^Operating earnings per share was chosen as the primary performance measure for 2014.
0.37908018^0.6970572^An operating earnings per share threshold of $3.15 per share was established that provided annual incentive funding for the plan as a whole only if the threshold was reached.

0.30155107^0.7700669^The compensation committee s determination of incentive compensation under our cash bonus program for all of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, was based on fiscal year 2015 revenue growth of 8.7% compared to a target of 8.0%, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movement, operating income growth of 10.4% compared to a target of 12.0%, excluding the impact of certain non-recurring items related to the Dealer Services spin-off, and sales growth of 12.7% compared to a target of 8.0%.

0.38487923^0.6947144^The measure of earnings was net operating earnings per share (after accounting for the cost of any incentive payout).
0.39715207^0.6937026^Net operating earnings was defined as income from continuing operations determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ), adjusted for certain items, such as weather, gains and losses on the sale of assets, certain out-of-period items and reserve adjustments.

0.47836193^0.757643^Total Potential Severity Rate ("TPSR")
0.4601064^0.76318043^The safety performance targets for 2014 were approved by the Compensation Committee and levels are set annually to motivate our executives to achieve continuous improvement in safety performance and to meet strict internal standards.
0.4608918^0.7632048^Safety performance targets are recommended to the Compensation Committee by the Board's Health Safety and Environment Committee.
0.47785944^0.7579473^The Compensation Committee measures our safety performance through a combination of components: Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR"), Total Potential Severity Rate ("TPSR") and Process Safety.
0.4649309^0.7643055^Each component makes up one-third of the overall safety performance metric.
0.47921735^0.7563834^The following charts show our actual performance related to the formulaic payout amounts for TRIR, TPSR and Process Safety.
0.31002742^0.7714812^Together, the safety metric outcomes resulted in a formulaic payout percentage for this measure of 38% of the total target bonus opportunity for each of the Named Executive Officers in 2014.
0.4793168^0.75687385^TRIR is a safety performance metric recognized by the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration and is used by companies across an array of different industries.
0.47999316^0.75626564^We calculate TRIR based upon the guidelines set forth by the International Association of Drilling Contractors (the "IADC"), an industry group for the drilling industry.
0.4788924^0.75767976^The IADC methodology calculates TRIR by taking the aggregate number of occurrences of work-related injuries or illnesses that result in any of the following: fatality; a physician or licensed health care professional recommending days away from work due to the injury or illness; an employee not being able to perform all of his or her routine job functions (but not resulting in days away from work); or any other medical care or treatment beyond minor first aid.
0.47972304^0.7567053^The TRIR is the number of such occurrences for every 200,000 employee hours worked.
0.47895712^0.75610185^The Compensation Committee approved a TRIR target for 2014 of .64, which would represent further progress toward our safety vision.
0.48055205^0.75428236^Any TRIR outcome representing a shortfall of more than 20% as compared to the target would result in a 0% bonus payout for the TRIR metric and any outcome representing an improvement of 20% or greater as compared to the target would result in a payout of 200% for the TRIR metric.
0.4798726^0.7550943^Our TRIR outcome for 2014 was .54, representing an improvement of just under 20% as compared to target.
0.48048282^0.75472534^This resulted in a formulaic result of 178% of target for the TRIR metric.
0.47822773^0.7580296^TPSR is an internally developed safety measure that we utilize to capture the potential severity of incidents over a period of time.
0.4783805^0.7577542^TPSR is calculated by taking the sum of all potential severity values assigned to the incidents, multiplying that number by 200,000, then dividing that number by total employee hours worked.
0.47784793^0.75805223^After the occurrence of an incident, the manager(s) responsible for the drilling unit or onshore facility where the incident took place complete an incident report that assigns a preliminary severity value to the incident.
0.3528307^0.8017907^The Company also has an independent oversight and review process to evaluate and confirm the potential severity assigned to each incident.
0.4780389^0.7575158^The severity value is derived by inputting data into our comprehensive severity calculator.
0.47514772^0.7594119^For instance, for dropped objects, the height from which the item was dropped and the weight of the object are inputs into the severity calculator.
0.4782768^0.7567291^The Compensation Committee approved a TPSR target for 2014 of 25.80, which represents further progress toward our safety vision.
0.48044646^0.7540466^Any TPSR outcome representing a shortfall of more than 20% as compared to the target would result in a 0% bonus payout for the TPSR metric and any outcome representing an improvement of 20% or greater as compared to the target would result in a payout of 200% for the TPSR metric.
0.48003584^0.7548427^Our TPSR outcome for 2014 of 30.88 represented close to a 20% shortfall as compared to the target.
0.48023444^0.75455546^This shortfall resulted in a formulaic result of 1.6% of target for the TPSR metric.
0.4794516^0.75687075^This TPSR measure, when considered in relation to TRIR offers a more holistic view of our safety performance.
0.4783697^0.75835717^During 2014, the company experienced a reduction in the number of recordable work related injuries or illnesses, leading to positive results reflected in TRIR; however, in reviewing our recordable safety incidents, we identified an increased prevalence of potential severity, leading to the weak TPSR result noted above.
0.46470216^0.7637719^Consistent with our commitment to safety, improving incident severity will be a point of focus for the Company in 2015.
0.46689832^0.7675637^We believe that in addition to personnel and behavioral safety, prevention and mitigation of major hazards or process incidents are critical components of a successful safety program.
0.46872127^0.76646954^Accordingly, Process Safety is an internally developed safety measure designed to assess the management of major hazards in order to prevent or mitigate a major accident or significant event.
0.46777815^0.76561034^To implement this safety measure, we measure the number of process safety events that are likely predictors or leading indicators of a potential significant event.
0.4644968^0.7642993^The 2014 target, for process safety events, was established equal to the baseline of events that occurred on our installations in 2013.
0.46654397^0.7652134^In 2014, the reduction in the number of process safety events resulted in maximum achievement of the Process Safety metric.
0.32697126^0.7982749^With the formulaic bonus outcome confirmed at 108%, the Compensation Committee then applied its discretion, taking into account views from the Health, Safety and Environmental Committee with respect to overall safety performance.

0.29543978^0.7065665^Mr. Lynch s award was structured so that 50 percent was based on achievement with respect to the adjusted Corporate Multiplier and 50 percent was based on performance of the regulated operations with respect to five specified performance measures: net income, safety, NOVs, customer satisfaction and service quality.
0.33958322^0.7787685^The HR Committee also established two extra credit goals for 2014, a 7.5 percent credit for zero fatalities and up to a 5 percent credit for cultural improvement.
0.33919913^0.77749324^The Company did not experience a fatal employee accident in 2014, which resulted in a 7.5 percent addition to the score.
0.39954704^0.75892484^In addition to reviewing each executive's contributions to the achievement of financial goals, for 2014, the Committee also considered the following key strategic objectives: (i) strengthening the Company's financial position; (ii) providing continuous flow of top-tier content; continuing to drive growth through strategic transformation of the Company; maintaining and building the Company's reputation as one of the most desirable organizations for top "talent"; (v) continuing to ensure a high degree of focus on the importance of a diverse workforce; and (vi) positioning the Company for long-term success.
0.451235^0.7510214^In lieu of the 25 percent weighting previously allocated to business transformation process, we increased our safety performance weighting to 15 percent from 5 percent and increased the weighting of each of our other three non-financial performance measures by 5 percent which increased each measure to 10 percent.
0.40835586^0.77615106^Ms. Miller   Continued to lead and improve our values and ethics program; provided leadership of our mergers and acquisitions function, overseeing an increase in our pipeline of potential opportunities; and provided oversight and advice for corporate governance matters and our stockholder engagement efforts.
0.3400973^0.7788552^In addition, the HR Committee established two extra credit goals for 2014: zero fatalities and culture, which could add an additional 7.5 percent and up to 5 percent to the score, respectively.

0.37517682^0.70272994^The Company s 2014 operating earnings per share, together with the Company s performance on strategic measures and safety, produced an initial score of 172.7 percent of target.
0.3329753^0.775079^Because the Company did not experience a fatal employee accident, 7.5 percent was added to the annual incentive award opportunity.
0.34147382^0.78076684^In addition, the HR Committee approved a 2.5 percent addition for the culture extra credit measure.
0.32079127^0.7908131^For AEP s annual incentive compensation, the HR Committee balances meeting AEP s operating earnings per share target with strategic, safety, zero fatality and corporate culture objectives.

0.22249883^0.79632956^As a result of discontinuing our Canadian operations we did not meet the minimum threshold established for tax purposes for fiscal 2014 (162(m) threshold) which led to the forfeiture of long-term and short-term incentive compensation for our executive officers described in more detail throughout the CD&A.
0.31816828^0.8076544^As a result of its review and evaluation of our fiscal year 2015 compensation programs, the HR Committee determined that our compensation policies and practices for our employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Coach.
0.18021433^0.78825545^As a result of that review, Jones New York was removed from the list due to a business restructuring, and J. Crew was added to the list since they began filing compensation information publicly following a debt offering.
0.30501^0.83372605^As a result of the competitive environment discussed above, market practices greatly influence our executive compensation programs.
0.22257444^0.7961098^As a result of the one-time charges associated with this decision, in March 2015 our Compensation Committee determined that we did not meet our 162(m) threshold for fiscal 2014.
0.23590752^0.7254804^As a result, 100% of the cash-settled performance units became eligible for time-based vesting over three years.
0.26674938^0.7716092^As a result, 2013 pay as shown in the Summary Compensation Table includes LTI awards granted for 2013 as well as part of the 2012 LTI grant, as described in more detail in Note 4 to the table.
0.30060115^0.7801423^As a result, 2014 bonus target levels as a percentage of base salary for the named executive officers were as follows:
0.26776958^0.7697913^As a result, a significant portion of the total compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table relates to awards made for performance in prior years or, in the case of performance awards, awards for future years in which performance has not yet been determined and for which the value is uncertain (and which may end up having no value at all).
0.30784172^0.73090386^As a result, achievement under the Long Term Incentive Award Program for the awards maturing on December 31, 2014 using exclusively the Operating Performance Metrics was determined to be 185.9% of Target overall.
0.29973897^0.6845506^As a result, achievement under the Long Term Incentive Award Program for the awards maturing on December 31, 2014 using exclusively the TSR Performance Metrics was determined to be 90.5% of Target overall.
0.30896604^0.67787457^As a result, achievement under the Long Term Incentive Award Program for the TSR awards maturing on December 31, 2014 was determined to be 90.5% of Target overall, (200% of Target for absolute TSR, 0% of Target for performance relative to the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index, and 71.2% of Target for performance relative to the FTSE NAREIT Equity Apartments Index).
0.15352593^0.7767155^As a result, each NEO s initial payout was 82% of target.
0.2399235^0.826489^As a result, most of the Company s compensation programs (including annual performance-based cash incentives, stock options and performance-based RSUs) are designed to qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m).
0.21700826^0.80423987^As a result, no STIP payouts were paid to our CEO this year or last year.
0.2125386^0.8048834^As a result, our CEO and other NEOs did not receive payouts under the STIP for fiscal 2014.
0.22243147^0.8850808^As a result, the amounts in column (h) related to Pension Benefits represent the combined impact of several factors: growth in the named executive officer s Pension Benefits over the measurement year; impact on the total present values of one year shorter discounting period due to the named executive officer being one year closer to normal retirement; impact on the total present values attributable to changes in assumptions from measurement date to measurement date; and impact on the total present values attributable to plan changes between measurement dates.
0.2372852^0.7238699^As a result, the Committee provided that the vesting of 30% of unvested performance shares would accelerate as of three trading days prior to the expected closing date of the Business Combination, subject to Mr. Salehpour s continued employment with Applied through the accelerated vest date and only if Mr. Salehpour is expected to be considered a  disqualified individual  under Section 4985.
0.24646875^0.7830249^As a result, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in Mr. Klappa s target award level to 110% from 105% of annual base salary.
0.29764262^0.80309296^As a result, the compensation program is designed to result in payouts that are market-appropriate given the Company s performance for the year or period.
0.33801687^0.7262621^As a result, the performance levels were increased by varying degrees, depending on the metric, in order to improve performance year-over-year.
0.37011203^0.81059873^As a secondary reference, the HR Committee informally considers publicly available data from foreign-listed and private companies that are Coach s direct competitors, such as Burberry.
0.22724599^0.78508353^As agreed to in his offer letter, Mr. Cornell received an annual LTI grant date present value of $9,000,000 in January 2015.
0.15319696^0.7769383^As an example, assume an NEO has an annual base salary of $500,000 and an annual APP target set at 50% of his base salary and that his APP award is based 70% on the Company s collective performance and 30% on his individual performance.
0.16330974^0.7826115^As context for understanding our 2014 NEO compensation, the following discussion summarizes the Company s financial and operational results and other notable accomplishments and business activities in 2014.
0.36458778^0.738863^As described above and throughout this CD&A, we utilize performance metrics core to our business within our STI (incentive earnings before interest and taxes and incentive economic value added) and LTI (relative market share growth, earnings per share growth, and return on invested capital) to drive strategy, measure our relative performance against retail competitors and determine actual payouts for each award.
0.19807954^0.7024921^As described above, in April 2015, certain of our NEOs received additional awards of either Series A Preferred Stock or Options.
0.4377889^0.82741714^As described above, the Compensation Committee reduced the final payouts for Ms. Greene (25%) and Messrs. Fanning (30%), Beattie (10%), and Bowers (10%) after the adjustments to performance results in connection with the 2014 Kemper IGCC Charges and Adjustments.
0.27974775^0.7159945^As described below, the Committee has established metrics to assist it in determining awards, if any, in each of these components.
0.43793696^0.83286047^As described in greater detail below in Calculating Payouts, Ms. Greene and Messrs. Fanning and Beattie are paid based on the equity-weighted average of the business unit net income results, which includes the net income goal achievement for Mississippi Power.
0.30250114^0.7697254^As described in the CD&A under  Annual Bonus Awards for 2014 , the following depicts the calculation of the portion of the 2014 annual bonus awards for the named executive officers that was based on the achievement of corporate performance measures.
0.22287549^0.79613435^As described under  Discontinuing Our Canadian Operations Results in 162(m) Threshold Not Being Met in Fiscal 2014,  this year we did not meet our 162(m) threshold, which affected our named executive officers  compensation.
0.3141299^0.75883865^As detailed in the chart below, entry level is the minimum level of financial performance for which the Compensation Committee approves any annual incentive payout under the AICP and the payout is 25% of target incentive compensation.
0.18300879^0.7735857^As discussed above, in fiscal 2014, the Committee also considered the impact of the punitive excise tax under Section 4985 on the value of equity awards held by NEOs in connection with the proposed Business Combination, and approved the payment by Applied of any Section 4985 excise tax, and related taxes on such payment, that is imposed on the equity awards granted to the NEOs in December 2014.
0.33275232^0.7677729^As discussed above, the 2014 annual Performance Pay Program goals and the total shareholder return goals applicable to performance shares were established early in the year by the Compensation Committee.
0.17489931^0.78033626^As discussed above, the Board is recommending that shareholders approve a new Executive Performance Plan for our most senior officers, including the NEOs.
0.15903643^0.7737907^As discussed above, the Compensation Committee set the annual incentive payout (as a percent of the target award) equal to the Overall AES Performance Score of 82% for the CEO and the other NEOs.
0.16909042^0.7525699^As discussed below under  Other Programs, Policies and Considerations Stock Ownership Guidelines,  the NEOs are required to hold between one and six times their respective base salaries in the Company s common stock, depending on their position.

0.34505907^0.8326955^Based on that review and discussion, we recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's 2015 Proxy Statement.
0.28950948^0.78789234^Based on the 2014 review, the target total direct compensation for Mr. Rusckowski, the Chief Executive Officer, was at the 49th percentile of the peer group, while the target total direct compensation for the other named executive officers ranged from the 17th percentile to the 81st percentile.
0.15391608^0.7738551^Based on the aggregate amount available for payment of APP awards, a corresponding individual factor is prescribed to each NEO s rating.
0.29609442^0.69547343^Based on the attained results and TSR Modifier the final number of shares to be granted would be calculated as follows: 7,200 shares X 111.25% X 130% = 10,413 shares
0.24656937^0.7820914^Based on the Company s performance against the financial and operational goals established by the Compensation Committee, Mr. Klappa received annual incentive cash compensation under the STPP of $2,893,255 for 2014.
0.35317993^0.7090581^Based on the Company s total shareholder return achievement relative to that of the Philadelphia Utility Index (28% payout) and the custom peer group (0% payout) as shown in the chart below, the payout percentage was 14% of target, which is the average of the two peer groups.

0.34449345^0.8329637^Based on the review and discussion referred to above, we recommend to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis referred to above be included in this proxy statement and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.
0.34511554^0.83247066^Based on the review and discussions, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in Applied s Proxy Statement for its 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

0.27648622^0.69882596^Based on the share price at grant and assuming the maximum market and financial performance conditions are achieved, the maximum value of the performance stock units granted in fiscal year 2014 and payable following completion of the 2014-2016 performance period are shown below.
0.25762016^0.8011974^Based on the stage of the Company's transformation and its assessment of each officer relative to market data, the Compensation Committee approved base salary increases for Mr. Mohan due to his expanded responsibilities (including assuming responsibility for store and space design and category operations) that resulted from several officer departures.
0.24940026^0.6804302^Based on the structure of the fiscal year 2013 Appointment Grant PRSU, there is no additional payment for the maximum achievement level.
0.27459624^0.72461593^Based on their assessment for 2014, the Committee awarded Mr. Craighead, Ms. Ross, and Messrs. Crain, Chariag, and Mathieson cash-based awards in the amounts of $1,068,369, $145,262, $352,503, $423,548 and $315,538, respectively.
0.31654903^0.82601064^Based on these beliefs, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company s executive compensation program should:
0.2816823^0.8270567^Based on these factors, most of the named executive officers received base salary increases in 2014, ranging from 1% to 4%, consistent with increases for most other employees.
0.15172863^0.7767^Based on these facts, the NEO s target APP award is $250,000, and his total APP factor is 1.21, resulting in an APP award of $302,500.
0.24317911^0.708149^Based on these results, the named executive officers received the following number of shares of restricted stock on February 12, 2015, in respect of the performance awards maturing on December 31, 2014, representing 117.8% of the restricted stock units relating to such period as described above.
0.30215722^0.7824931^Based on this assessment, the Compensation Committee established the total target compensation opportunity in early 2014 for each named executive officer.
0.30950454^0.80475616^Based on this comprehensive review in 2014, we concluded that our compensation program does not encourage excessive risk-taking for the following reasons:
0.3450075^0.8326489^Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our annual report on Form 10-K and this proxy statement.
0.34503123^0.8323842^Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K and in this proxy statement.
0.34440985^0.83288896^Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, and in this proxy statement.
0.15928335^0.7812549^Based on this review, the current level of target total direct compensation (including base salary, target annual incentives and long-term incentives) for the NEOs was, on balance, positioned within a reasonable range of competitive norms, and the Committee considered these findings when determining base salaries, target annual incentives and long-term incentive grants for the balance of 2014, as well as for 2015.
0.3197893^0.70094556^Based on this value, the maximum performance unit payout would be $5,792,281, $4,532,400, $1,920,101, $1,561,160 and $1,444,703 for Mr. Craighead, Ms. Ross and Messrs. Crain, Chariag and Mathieson, respectively.
0.24615031^0.7848382^Based upon all of the factors described above and the results of the Board s annual CEO evaluation, the Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to revise the market median for Mr. Klappa and to set his 2014 annual base salary at $1,283,040, approximately 3% outside this target range.
0.24825782^0.78101957^Based upon Mr. Leverett s significant contributions to the success of the Company, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Leverett s base salary approximately 3.2% over his 2013 base salary that became effective upon being named President of WEC in August 2013.
0.25050932^0.7634109^Based upon the level of business unit achievement and the level of corporate performance achievement each noted above, the 2014 bonus award, as a percentage of base salary, for each of Messrs. Holland, Beasley and Collins was equal to 99.3%, 104.7% and 109.8%, respectively.
0.34482554^0.8333696^Based upon this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section be included in the Company s 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K on file with the SEC and the Company s 2015 Proxy Statement.(1)
0.29529974^0.85348344^Based upon this review, we believe that the perquisites we provide to the executive officers are generally market competitive and reflect the practices of other similarly-sized companies.

0.26162294^0.71094227^became one of only two U.S. airlines with investment grade credit ratings;
0.2332339^0.8784071^Because Messrs. Craighead and Crain are eligible for retirement under the 2002 D&O Plan based upon their ages and years of service with the Company and, accordingly, their options will automatically vest upon retirement, the Company expenses the full value of their options upon grant for purposes of FASB ASC Topic 718.
0.44871122^0.88428164^Because Mr. McCrary retired from Alabama Power effective May 1, 2014, the maximum amount he could earn is $241,007, which is prorated based on the number of months he was employed during the performance period.
0.44876313^0.88439167^Because Mr. McCrary retired in 2014, the amount reported for him in 2014 reflects the actual benefits expected to be paid after the measurement date.
0.31473964^0.8064933^Because of the presence of the risk mitigators identified above and the design of our compensation program, we believe that the risks arising from our employee compensation program are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect upon AES.
0.4607515^0.8206056^Because of the technical nature of the industry, cyclical nature of the markets, high labor needs and capital requirements, oilfield service companies provide the best competitive benchmarks.
0.36132765^0.82326335^Because of the use of market data from a large number of industry peer companies for positions that are not identical in terms of scope of responsibility from company to company, differences are not considered to be material and the compensation program is believed to be market- appropriate, as long as senior management as a group is within an appropriate range.
0.21312204^0.6948763^Because of this stock-based expensing and the impact of dilution to our shareholders, we closely monitor the number and the fair values of the option shares.
0.28589076^0.8240621^Because the charges were not excluded, the payout levels for all employees, including the named executive officers, were reduced significantly in 2013.
0.20876127^0.694654^Because the closing price of our common stock on the date of the fiscal 2015 annual LTI grant ($29.91, as quoted on the NYSE for August 18, 2014) was higher than the average trading price from the month prior to the fiscal 2014 annual LTI grant ($20.93, for the month of March 2013) the conversion rates used in fiscal 2015 resulted in fewer options and restricted shares being awarded to our NEOs for the same value.
0.32618028^0.76032305^Because the Company s performance against the financial and operational goals resulted in significant STPP awards in 2014, the Compensation Committee determined that no further adjustments based upon individual contributions or otherwise were appropriate.
0.24080344^0.8265203^Because the Company s policy is to maximize long- term stockholder value, as described fully in this CD&A, tax deductibility is not the only factor considered in setting compensation.
0.30406627^0.82129395^Because the Named Executive Officers are primarily responsible for the overall execution of the Company s strategy, a high percentage of their total direct compensation is variable and tied to Company performance, thereby providing incentives to achieve goals that help create value for stockholders.
0.391162^0.8201245^Because this is a different business model than WEC s, these companies have been excluded from the peer group.

0.25331602^0.6854905^Beginning in January 2014, we aligned our equity grant dates for executives officers so that all annual equity grants occur in January each year, instead of our previous practice of granting RSUs or PBRSUs in January and PSUs in March.
0.2558963^0.6838833^Beginning in January 2014, we changed our grant timing practices to grant both PBRSUs and PSUs in January.

0.33633962^0.7280606^For the 2011 - 2013 period, the minimum levels of performance for all three measures were exceeded.
0.30386212^0.69411117^For the 2012-2014 performance stock unit grant, the 48.7% vesting level, discussed above, is reflected in the chart.
0.30956966^0.70596147^For the 2012-2014 performance stock units:
0.3251351^0.7697966^For the 2013-2015 Performance Unit Awards, the Compensation Committee approved a change to the applicable financial metrics.
0.30457574^0.7540531^For the 2014 Annual Bonus there were four corporate goals:
0.30428755^0.7688074^For the 2014 performance period under the Executive Bonus Plan (under which each of the named executive officers is covered), annual bonus awards were determined based upon the following achievement of our pre-established primary performance goals for 2014, as certified by the Compensation Committee (in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code):
0.27191636^0.8336896^For the 2014 tax year, the Company paid the Named Executive Officers a total of $4.0 million which was not deductible.
0.28544348^0.7147713^For the 2014-2016 Performance Units Awards, the payout will be settled in stock rather than cash.
0.23288035^0.7077641^For the CEO, 50% performance share awards (using TSR as the performance metric), 20% stock options and 30% time-based restricted shares.
0.3785434^0.7081865^For the financial goals, such adjustments typically include the impact of items considered non-recurring or outside of normal operations or not anticipated in the business plan when the financial goals were established and of sufficient magnitude to warrant recognition.
0.23041847^0.6994668^For the first time, incorporated performance restricted stock units ( PRSUs ) as part of regular long-term incentive awards for all NEOs and other key leaders, while reducing use of stock options (one-third PRSUs, one-third stock options and one-third RSUs).
0.3437469^0.7698172^For the FY15-17 PRSUs, the HR Committee determined that the performance measures would be linked to three key metrics measuring performance for the three year period beginning fiscal year 2015 and ending fiscal year 2017, aligned with our long-term strategic plan and brand transformation activities shared on Analyst Day:
0.344829^0.76790047^For the FY16-18 PRSUs, the performance metrics continue to be North America average dollar per transaction growth, continued progress on global store renovations, and international sales growth.
0.26333472^0.6910582^For the grant made in 2014, the value per unit was $37.54.
0.2111044^0.7103612^For the grants made in 2014, unvested options are forfeited if the named executive officer retires from the Southern Company system and accepts a position with a peer company within two years of retirement.
0.24443346^0.7218646^For the grants made in December 2014, the Compensation Committee determined that performance-based vesting will occur upon the achievement of an emerging markets sales growth goal over the two-year performance period from January 2015 through December 2016.
0.31217957^0.67523843^For the January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014 performance period, the Company ranked 7th in total shareholder return (TSR) among its airline peer group and in the 98th percentile versus entities in the S&P Index.
0.30177394^0.69314194^For the January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2016 performance period, the vesting of 50% of the stock units subject to the award will be determined in accordance with the chart below based on the Company s TSR rank versus the companies in the airline peer group, and the vesting of 50% of the stock units subject to the award will be determined in accordance with the chart below based on the Company s TSR percentile rank versus all of the companies in the Standard & Poor s 500 index.
0.23176119^0.875551^For the Named Executive Officers, Company contributions to the Defined-Contribution Officers Supplementary Retirement Plan (DC-OSRP) in lieu of the defined-benefit plan are reported in Column (i) and detailed in the table in Footnote (5) below.
0.30815542^0.77688277^For the Named Executive Officers, the 2014 target participation levels are as follows:
0.3090105^0.82155025^For the named executive officers, the Committee establishes target compensation consistent, to the extent possible, with comparable positions in the peer group and provides our named executive officers with the opportunity to earn greater rewards for performance that exceeds established goals.
0.28693515^0.81369853^For the other Named Executive Officers, as well as for other elected officers of the Company, the Committee generally targets base salary between the 25th and 50th percentile of airline peers and provides executives an opportunity to achieve total direct compensation at the 50th percentile if annual and long-term incentive targets are reached, and to surpass the 50th percentile if those targets are exceeded.
0.15462764^0.7766048^For the other NEOs, 55% of target total compensation is performance-based.
0.20145269^0.7025228^For the other NEOs: one-third performance share awards (using TSR as the performance metric), one-third stock options and one-third time-based restricted shares.
0.23358846^0.72155744^For the performance periods following shareholder approval of the Executive Performance Plan, the full value of restricted stock grants that vest will be treated as part of each officer's annual award under the Executive Performance Plan for the year in which vesting occurs, to the extent that full value, when combined with other incentive payments to the officer, does not exceed the officer's maximum allocation under the plan for that year.
0.29416046^0.70567095^For the performance year 2014, similar to 2013, actual earn-outs from performance shares were well below the targeted opportunity, reflecting sub-par three-year performance results.
0.30068567^0.68224406^For the same reasons, the Committee decided that the performance units would not include TSR as an additional goal, as it has done in previous years, because including a TSR goal likely would have also made the awards subject to the punitive excise tax.
0.28294778^0.8244607^For the second consecutive year, the Committee determined that, absent an increase in responsibilities, the base salary for each named executive officer would not be increased from the prior year level.
0.30573606^0.6946084^For the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2014, our total stockholder return was at the 52nd percentile of the peer group, resulting in the performance units vesting at a level of 102.4%.
0.32796165^0.73407257^For the year ended December 31, 2014,
0.38543415^0.69385517^For the year, our earnings per share on an adjusted non-GAAP basis was $4.22.
0.40591145^0.71071875^For the year, revenue was a record $24.6 billion, up 10% compared to $22.4 billion for 2013 and we delivered on the key objectives for 2014.
0.23639424^0.8262912^For these reasons, the Compensation Committee s compensation policy and practices are not directly guided by considerations relating to Section 162(m).
0.37556845^0.65639496^For this award, performance was based entirely on the achievement of the Company s cumulative EBITDA less CapEx target for the 2012-2014 period.
0.37369224^0.7184911^For this performance period and for subsequent performance periods, the metrics are revenue growth and ROCE measured both in absolute and relative growth terms.

0.37431198^0.6904459^Funding the Bonus Plan within a range of 1.0x to 1.24x required an adjusted EPS for fiscal 2014 within a range of $1.00 to $1.29, and an adjusted EPS above or below this range would have increased or decreased the multiplier.
0.43496102^0.68416363^Funds from Operations attributable to common stockholders   diluted ( FFO ) per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 43.6% to $7.25, while  Core FFO  (also known as  Operating FFO ), which is defined as FFO adjusted for non-routine items as detailed in the Company s Earnings Release on January 28, 2015, increased by 8.8% over the prior year to $6.78.

0.27749643^0.87480414^However, because in such cases the aircraft is being used for a business purpose, there is no incremental cost associated with the family travel, and no amounts are included for such travel.
0.25395945^0.77765095^However, because of Mr. Leverett s role in the Company s succession plan, we recommended, and the Compensation Committee approved, a higher target value.
0.4361633^0.82662505^However, because the strategic goals related to the Kemper IGCC were not fully executed in 2014, the Compensation Committee determined that the final payout for certain executive officers most accountable for high-level strategic decisions concerning the Kemper IGCC, including some of the named executive officers, should be reduced from the amount they would have otherwise received.
0.23970151^0.827785^However, compensation that does not exceed $1 million during any fiscal year or that qualifies as  performance-based compensation  (as defined in Section 162(m)) is deductible.

0.244634^0.8285935^However, in some cases, we determine that it is appropriate to provide compensation that may exceed deductibility limits in order to meet market demands and retain key executives.
0.22824313^0.6958048^However, in the limited circumstances that the change in control results in none of the common stock of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent entity) being publicly traded following a change in control, then all such RSUs and stock options will vest in full, and all performance conditions for performance-based RSUs will be deemed satisfied at their target level, upon the change in control.

0.2946192^0.74968696^However, the aggregate bonuses paid under the plan cannot exceed the overall bonus pool funding.
0.24143428^0.8256222^However, the Committee has authorized in the past, and may authorize in the future, compensation that is not fully tax deductible, but which promote other important considerations, such as incentive and retention needs.
0.27706406^0.8120599^However, the Committee may decide to set the CEO s salary below the
0.24238163^0.8249986^However, the Committee reserves the right to design programs that recognize a full range of performance criteria important to its success, even where the compensation paid under such programs may not be deductible.

0.21198782^0.7034143^However, the O&C Committee has not granted stock options under the Long-Term Incentive Plan since 2010.

0.17506813^0.7698685^However, the performance units will vest immediately at the target 100% rate upon (1) the termination of the NEO s employment by reason of disability or death or (2) a change in control of WEC while the NEO is employed by WEC.

0.31146124^0.78712976^If so, and if the amount paid in an annual incentive award or the shares vesting in a performance-based long-term incentive award would have been less had the financial statements been correct, the HR Committee will recover compensation from the covered employee as it deems appropriate.
0.23927392^0.82549596^If that compensation does not qualify for a deduction under Section 162(m), there could be a modest effect on the Company s dividend requirements to qualify as a REIT or on the tax characterization of such dividends.

0.24107723^0.82595974^Our short-term and long-term compensation programs, including the compensation paid in fiscal 2014, are intended to qualify as deductible performance based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).
0.33063072^0.7504393^Our STIP program for fiscal 2014 was based on two metrics and appropriately challenging goals set at the beginning of the performance period:
0.23179564^0.70257336^Our stock option, RSU, and PRSU grants contain a financial penalty (clawback) (which extends for a period beyond the exercise of options or the vesting of RSUs or PRSUs) for executives who violate our non-competition and/or non-solicitation rules or who violate other business standards established by Coach.
0.21267027^0.7090676^Our stock options and RSUs generally have five-year cliff vesting tied to continued employment with the Company, and management has sizable stock positions relative to their income, which together encourage focus on the long-term value of our stock, aligns management s and stockholders  interests and discourages excessive risk taking to optimize short-term and non-sustainable performance.
0.1802152^0.7285675^Our stock ownership guidelines require that senior management holds a significant amount of the Company s common stock to further align their interests with stockholders over the long-term by having a portion of their personal investment portfolio consist of Company stock, and we expect this component to be a risk mitigator on a prospective basis.
0.2424179^0.8242973^Our Stock Plan and Bonus Plan are intended to permit (but not require) the Committee to award compensation that is  performance-based  and thus fully tax-deductible by Applied.
0.2361202^0.874732^Our supplemental executive retirement benefits are designed primarily to restore benefits capped under our broad-based retirement plans due to statutory limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code );

0.3701771^0.7776017^Over the long term, Coach s primary objective continues to be driving sustained increases in stockholder value through ongoing sales and earnings growth.

0.17173532^0.76864994^The Committee also recognized the need for our NEOs to continue to drive Applied toward the additional growth and positive results that may be achieved through the successful consummation of the Business Combination, and the importance of motivating the NEOs to continue to effectively operate Applied s business and encourage them to stay focused on longer-term goals with as few distractions as possible.

0.25332963^0.71265185^The Committee awarded equity awards to our named executive officers having the same value as the awards that they received in 2013 (except Mr. Davis, whose equity award was increased, reflecting his increased responsibilities upon becoming Senior Vice President, Operations).
0.4011854^0.70447826^The Committee believed that an absolute annual adjusted operating profit margin was an appropriate goal because it both continued to require effort in maintaining recent successes in operating profit improvements while not being so difficult to achieve that it might diminish NEO focus on other critical strategic initiatives and financial goals.
0.1790106^0.7674929^The Committee believed that cash-settled performance units subject to an annual adjusted operating profit margin goal, coupled with the NEOs  equity holdings that were still subject to performance goals and time-based vesting, would maintain the alignment of the NEOs  interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders.
0.18198365^0.7713462^The Committee believed that granting cash-settled performance units would help to alleviate the extra tax burden that the NEOs would face as a result of Section 4985, while still providing key retention and performance incentives.

0.20366026^0.7619872^The Committee believed that providing for a prorated bonus for Mr. Splinter was appropriate because of his critical role in moving Applied toward a successful completion of the Business Combination (including through his support of the proposed Business Combination with respect to customer relations, regulatory matters, integration planning and navigating cultural issues between the companies), as well as to provide Mr. Splinter continued incentive to drive performance for Applied.
0.1541937^0.77758956^The Committee believed that target bonus amounts for the NEOs for fiscal 2014 were consistent with our philosophy of linking pay to our performance and helped us reach our target annual total direct compensation of within the 50th to 75th percentile range relative to the peer group.
0.21268071^0.771091^The Committee believed that the excise tax would negatively affect the incentive and retention value of long-term incentive equity awards, and in turn employee morale and retention, during a period of transition, uncertainty and tremendous effort in preparing for the consummation of the Business Combination.
0.1767818^0.76862085^The Committee believed that this could potentially have a negative effect on Applied s retention efforts at a time when retention of our NEOs was of paramount importance, both to manage the business and drive toward a successful completion of the Business Combination and integration with Tokyo Electron.
0.2394749^0.73143417^The Committee believed that this partial vesting acceleration would alleviate a portion of the extra tax burden that Mr. Salehpour would incur as a result of the successful closing of the Business Combination, while substantially preserving the long-term incentive and retention value of his equity award, as it remains subject to time-based vesting and Mr. Salehpour s continued future employment.

0.31764925^0.79945076^The Committee believes that seeking to pay within this range furthers our goals of attracting, rewarding and retaining highly talented individuals, and motivating them to achieve goals that enhance stockholder value.
0.2306203^0.7146203^The Committee believes that stock options, time-based restricted stock units and performance stock units each provide incentives that are important to the Company s executive compensation program as a whole.

0.32533^0.8367807^The Committee believes that the vote indicates that most stockholders approve of the structure of executive compensation at Alaska Air Group.

0.31285885^0.8151448^The Committee believes that this approach balances the performance potential among the three elements of equity compensation and improves the deductibility of our LTI compensation with 2/3 of each named executive s LTI opportunity tied to Company performance
0.17612006^0.7673929^The Committee believes that this dual-level performance framework appropriately emphasizes Company achievement of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, which are important measures of operating and financial performance, while providing necessary flexibility to focus on the achievement of key business imperatives by individual NEOs.
0.30967814^0.8068219^The Committee believes that this mix of short-term and long-term compensation allows it to achieve dual goals of attracting and retaining highly qualified executives and providing meaningful performance incentives for those executives.
0.31969312^0.8145703^The Committee believes that this program, emphasizing performance shares and options for our most senior employees, including all of our executive officers, reflects a focus on pay for performance and competitive considerations, and supports our business strategy.
0.3594005^0.7694719^The Committee believes this balance of shared and personal goals is critical to an overall assessment of performance.
0.35675433^0.7863604^The Committee carefully considers all of the factors influencing the results and the Senior Executive's performance impacting those results.

0.16079043^0.7805313^The Committee considers these requirements when designing compensation programs for NEOs.

0.24179824^0.6862087^The weighted-average assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair value of option awards are shown below and in note 5 to the financial statements of our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015:
0.40962064^0.75999343^The weighting of the priorities, which is also consistent with fiscal 2014, placed the greatest emphasis on overall profit and top line revenue growth while also giving significant weight to our fiscal 2015 Renew Blue strategic priorities.
0.36006364^0.7462468^The weights, which can change from year-to-year, are determined based on the Company's key priorities and areas of focus for the upcoming year.
0.4845909^0.8366971^The Williams Companies, Inc.
0.16667555^0.772048^Then, these target awards are adjusted based on the RNC s determination of the total pool size and its subjective review of the NEO s individual overall performance during the fiscal year.
0.22166777^0.8352291^There are no tax gross-ups provided in connection with these payments or incremental benefits.
0.26571122^0.7178104^There are, however, significant limits on awards that the Awards Committee may grant.
0.42347586^0.7372718^There continues to be significant uncertainty in the market in regards to the impact of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the United States.
0.21485662^0.8201666^There is no enhanced benefit for executives.
0.27817702^0.8750248^There is no incremental cost to the Company for this travel, other than the reimbursement for taxes paid on imputed income attributable to the executives for this perquisite, as the airplane cost is the same regardless of whether an executive s spouse travels.
0.2149167^0.8171706^There is no pre-established weight assigned to these considerations.
0.22023281^0.83599925^There is no provision for the gross-up of excise taxes in connection with change-in-control severance payments.
0.21337181^0.81631804^There is no relationship between the timing of the granting of awards and our release of material non-public information.
0.22014913^0.8179646^There is no separate net income goal set for the Company as a whole or for Southern Nuclear.
0.27384835^0.8169602^There is not a well-defined market median for Mr. Leverett because of his unique role as both the principal executive officer of our electric generation operations and President of the holding company.
0.21227585^0.8159162^There were no adjustments to the 2012-2014 PSUs after the grant date.
0.21191345^0.81983566^There were no off-cycle grants made to the named executive officers in 2014.
0.21156609^0.70329773^There were no stock options granted in 2012, 2013 or 2014.
0.33971977^0.6955521^Therefore, an incremental increase of three cents per share would be required to achieve the maximum payout level.
0.24175808^0.8280648^Therefore, any amounts attributable to that restricted stock is not tax deductible if and to the extent that such restricted stock causes the compensation of the covered Named Executive Officer to exceed $1,000,000 for the year.
0.29455635^0.7430707^Therefore, in 2014, the Company strove for and rewarded:
0.2109935^0.82288736^Therefore, Messrs. Keyes and Garvin, and Ms. Martin, have not entered into an employment agreement that provides for these benefits.
0.21243058^0.8165684^Therefore, no information has been provided for 2012.
0.24432556^0.70963^Therefore, our executives  compensation included restricted stock for 185.9% of the performance units measured solely against the Operating Performance Metrics maturing at the end of 2014.
0.24459586^0.7096329^Therefore, our executives  compensation included restricted stock for only 90.5% of the performance units measured solely against the TSR Performance Metrics maturing at the end of 2014.
0.29557905^0.8321718^Therefore, some executives may be paid above and others below market.
0.262709^0.7082011^Therefore, the 2014 equity grant values shown in the Summary Compensation Table reflect 2/3 of the grant value approved in 2014 and granted in 2014 and 1/3 of the grant value approved in 2013 and granted in 2014.
0.25601^0.7078932^Therefore, the Committee generally allocates the grant-date value (based on the principles used in the Company s financial reporting) of each executive s total equity incentive award among these three types of awards.
0.31093985^0.82671154^Therefore, the Committee structured executive compensation for 2014 in a way that is generally consistent with that of 2013.
0.23816758^0.8256484^Therefore, the RNC has not adopted a policy that requires that all compensation be deductible.
0.26619405^0.7837478^Therefore, the salary amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table are different than the amounts shown above because that table reports actual amounts paid in 2014.
0.21013638^0.70760596^Therefore, their options are presumed to have a shorter expected life, which results in a lower option value.
0.37112033^0.6920376^Therefore, we believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings is relevant and useful to investors to understand WEC s operating performance.
0.21542783^0.7042874^Therefore, we currently use open market purchases to satisfy our benefit plan obligations, including the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock.
0.26523894^0.73039204^These  special recognition awards  are designed to foster an alignment of stockholder interests with a broader group of employees, and to incent these employees to continue to perform at a high level.

0.19630924^0.845449^These agreements provide that we indemnify such persons against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, to advance their expenses incurred as a result of a proceeding as to which they may be indemnified and to cover such persons under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policy we choose, in our discretion, to maintain.

0.17021996^0.7892795^These amounts reflect our matching contributions to the NEOs' Retirement Savings Plan accounts and include true-up contributions made during fiscal 2015 to NEOs who had not previously received the prior year's maximum matching contribution.
0.32229805^0.75255597^These amounts reflect STI payments made for all fiscal years shown.
0.24284069^0.6846663^These amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value for stock-based awards granted to our NEOs for all fiscal years reflected.
0.25311434^0.87679404^These amounts reflect the portions of premiums paid by us for life insurance coverage exceeding $50,000.
0.24688035^0.68768466^These amounts represent the grant date fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares granted in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in accordance with ASC Topic 718.
0.27815098^0.82294786^These amounts were based on the individual officer s fiscal 2014 base salary and position.
0.22289455^0.8850928^These amounts were determined by comparing the present value of each named executive officer s accrued benefit under the Employees  Retirement Plan and the SERP in 2011 with the present value of the accrued benefit under these plans in 2012.
0.2225272^0.88544834^These amounts were determined by comparing the present value of each named executive officer s accrued benefit under the Employees  Retirement Plan and the SERP in 2012 with the present value of the accrued benefit under these plans in 2013.
0.22276217^0.8852401^These amounts were determined by comparing the present value of each named executive officer s accrued benefit under the Employees  Retirement Plan and the SERP in 2013 with the present value of the accrued benefit under these plans in 2014.
0.4683054^0.76645744^These are events that elevate risk to the operation and include such things as significant damage to aircraft or other assets, injuries to employees or customers, or a significant reduction in safety.
0.42385748^0.7680009^These are the categories we are well known for and our guests have asked us to lead with them in the years ahead.
0.29718286^0.76578045^These are the same adjustments that the Committee approved for the 2013 annual incentive compensation under the SMIP and were discussed in the Company s 2014 proxy statement.
0.26483396^0.7310122^These awards align an executive s opportunity with the creation of value for stockholders.
0.40602314^0.7978101^These awards are also a valuable tool to retain executives with long-term potential, consistent with succession planning goals
0.2643931^0.6936524^These awards had a grant date fair value of  $111.77 per unit for the TSR Metric portion of the award, based on the Monte Carlo value on the date of grant, and $128.97per unit for the Operating Metric portion of the award, based on the closing price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant.
0.26183516^0.6946927^These awards had a grant date value of  $128.97 per unit, based on the closing price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on the date of grant.

0.3001162^0.84306955^This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) focuses on how our Named Executive Officers (NEOs) were compensated for fiscal 2014 (February 2, 2014 through January 31, 2015) and how their fiscal 2014 compensation aligns with our pay for performance philosophy.
0.28124225^0.79683995^This Compensation Discussion and Analysis contains a more detailed discussion of each of the above components and the extent to which we analyzed market data in establishing each individual component in 2014.
0.30230418^0.8422117^This Compensation Discussion and Analysis, or  CD&A,  explains, for 2014, our executive compensation philosophy and objectives, each element of our executive compensation program and how the Compensation Committee (the  Committee ) of the Board made its compensation decisions for our 2014 named executive officers ( NEOs ) listed below:
0.23110278^0.8116857^This component can only be earned if the Company achieves at least the threshold level of Coach, Inc. operating income established under the financial component.
0.26730967^0.73499113^This contribution is made for those employees active on the last day of the calendar year and based on total pay received while participating during the calendar year.
0.3603027^0.69449645^This correction adds $30,477.
0.22070114^0.88576245^This correction was only reflected in the calculation of his December 31, 2014 accrued benefit so the increase is included in his 2014 change in pension value in the SERP.
0.33371183^0.72525626^This earned amount may increase to up to 300% of target based on achievement of a performance multiplier established for 2014, as described below.
0.36063233^0.6886141^This earnings level equates to a CAGR of 6.7% from WEC s 2011 earnings per share.
0.3205048^0.7357129^This error was discovered in 2015, and an additional 1,842 of 2014-2016 target units were awarded to Mr. Naughton in 2015.
0.40772945^0.75694716^This expanded role resulted from a new organizational structure implemented in August 2014 to better align the Company to our growth opportunities, increase focus on key areas of value creation, and pave the way for rapid integration with Tokyo Electron.
0.25611025^0.7144236^This followed three consecutive years in which the value of the equity awards for our named executive officers in each year was lower than it was the preceding year (except Mr. Rusckowski, who joined the Company in 2012 and whose 2013 equity award was the same as his 2012 equity award).
0.3993377^0.7281318^This investment plan included spending approximately $70 million in 2013 and again in 2014 on over 40 targeted projects that the Company believes provide opportunities for improved long-term revenue growth.
0.3480716^0.7086028^This is a drop of approximately 3.6%.
0.36101812^0.7372915^This is accomplished with comprehensive performance metrics, such as:
0.23687252^0.8258581^This limitation does not apply to compensation that meets the tax code requirements for qualifying performance-based compensation.
0.16928144^0.7204319^This means the Company is referring you to information that has previously been filed with the SEC and that this information should be considered as part of the filing you are reading.
0.17748998^0.85893035^This means there is a  double trigger  before severance benefits are paid; i.e., there must be both a change in control and a termination of employment.
0.2641429^0.7130795^This mix consisted entirely of equity-based awards and 80% of the 2014 mix was performance-based as follows:
0.38108796^0.76329696^This mix was designed to provide a balance of incentives to executives for creating long-term shareholder value through strong financial and operating performance and to align executive interests with shareholder interests.
0.33082527^0.6992178^This new  performance curve  required a higher level of incremental performance to earn the prior 133% maximum payout and a significantly higher level of incremental performance to earn the new 200% maximum payout.
0.24626574^0.72173166^This objective has been achieved in previous years through grants of equity awards that were subject to both performance goals and additional time-based vesting requirements.
0.16441426^0.7628474^This outcome confirmed the Company s view that the NEO compensation program is performance-based and aligns with our stockholders  interests.
0.24173577^0.6840774^This outcome demonstrates the Company s pay for performance philosophy since generally the NEOs will only realize the grant date fair value if the share price appreciates subsequent to the grant date.
0.48392186^0.83681136^This outcome is based on our 13-company retail peer group at the time of that grant: Amazon.com, Best Buy, Costco, CVS Caremark, Home Depot, J.C. Penney, Kohl s, Kroger, Lowe s, Macy s, Sears, Walgreens and Walmart.
0.17685926^0.7742573^This partial acceleration of vesting helps to mitigate some, but not all, of the 15% excise tax impact on our NEOs.
0.17405853^0.7787174^This payment does not increase the benefit of the awards to the NEOs, but is simply intended to place them in the same position as if there were no punitive excise tax.
0.39143956^0.8203547^This peer group was chosen because we believe these companies are similar to WEC in terms of business model and long-term strategies, with a focus on regulated utility operations rather than a non-regulated business model.
0.37544748^0.6569998^This performance unit award paid out at 97.5% of the target cash value based on our actual EBITDA less CapEx result of $8.0B, which was 99.4% of the target EBITDA less CapEx goal of $8.1B as detailed in the following table.
0.20678103^0.704899^This policy applied to all previously issued stock options and to options issued in the future, if any.
0.3017406^0.7858263^This policy applies to any performance-based annual or long-term incentives awarded to our Named Executive Officers as well as other key executives.
0.22414532^0.8383397^This policy formalizes WEC s practice since the beginning of 2006 to not include any provisions requiring a gross-up for excise tax in any new executive employment agreement, as well as the Compensation Committee s policy since July 2011 to eliminate tax gross-ups on perquisites provided by the Company to its officers (except to officers who were already receiving gross-ups as of July 2011).
0.18530129^0.8246284^This policy is in addition to any requirements which might be imposed pursuant to Section 304 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and will be modified to the extent required by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and the related final rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
0.27688435^0.7586913^This positioning is primarily related to organizational changes over recent years where Senior Executives in new positions have received long term incentive compensation below the 75th percentile.
0.38896155^0.7794036^This practice allows for differentiation based on time in the position, scope of responsibilities, and individual performance.
0.3612828^0.7894966^This procedure is consistent with prior practices.
0.24464366^0.83038235^This provision disallows the deductibility of certain compensation to our Named Executive Officers in excess of $1 million per year unless it is considered performance-based compensation under the Code.
0.3417607^0.8084135^This report is submitted by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
0.16911322^0.7203015^This report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management s current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties.
0.25311482^0.7989404^This represented 225% of his annual base salary.
0.24638292^0.7885412^This represents a 3.1% increase over Mr. Klappa s 2013 base salary.
0.23797154^0.7126948^This results in a balanced portfolio of compensation rewards consisting of, for the CEO, 50% performance share awards (to reward relative performance), 20% stock options (to reward absolute share price appreciation) and 30% time-based restricted shares (to promote retention), as shown below.
0.3022564^0.8376724^This review included consideration of the following specific elements of the Company s executive compensation policies and procedures:
0.27283272^0.7829296^This section describes performance-based compensation for 2014.
0.2904484^0.8318901^This section describes the compensation program for the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2014, as well as the compensation program for each of the Company s other three most highly compensated executive officers serving at the end of the year.
0.17896922^0.8579494^This severance amount is the same as that which had been provided for Mr. Splinter while he was CEO from 2003 to 2013, and would be subject to Mr. Dickerson s agreeing to a release of claims and non-solicitation and non-disparagement provisions in favor of Applied.
0.19208147^0.84967834^This structure essentially places the decision of whether or not to trigger change of control benefits largely in the hands of the acquiring company, since a change of control alone would not trigger the benefit.
0.3885837^0.7537103^This system provides a foundation for day-to-day management, including best-in-class business performance tools, and will help us to develop the capabilities that we need to manage the Company more effectively.
0.2649906^0.7871449^This table differs from the Summary Compensation Table provided on page 38, which includes several items that are driven by accounting and actuarial assumptions that are not necessarily reflective of the compensation actually realized by the executive in a particular year.
0.28759024^0.82924426^This table summarizes the compensation for 2014 for each of our named executive officers.
0.2587935^0.79557264^This target level of compensation is expressed as a percentage of base salary.
0.35425407^0.6875908^This value was based on the volume weighted price of WEC s common stock for the ten trading days beginning on December 2, 2013 and ending on December 13, 2013.
0.18117863^0.77079666^This vesting acceleration is conditioned upon the closing of the Business Combination and will apply only if the NEO is expected to be a  disqualified individual  and subject to a 15% excise tax under Section 4985 on such equity awards.
0.32278922^0.8411669^This vote is advisory, which means that the vote to approve the Company s executive compensation is not binding on the Company, our Board or the HR Committee of the Board.
0.26001465^0.69070387^This was a change in practice from fiscal 2014 when we used the average price from the month prior to the grant date to calculate the number of units.
0.41883403^0.7471223^This was made possible by managing the business more efficiently and delivering on our strategy of converting innovations into earnings through new technologies that provide value to customers and competitive differentiations for the Company.
0.4102801^0.884966^This year, as previously indicated, Mr. Rainer joined the company as President and Chief Operating Officer in September 2014, relocating from Chicago to New York; Mr. Cohen returned from a part-time consulting role to become Chief of Staff to Mr. Luis in September 2014; he was promoted to President, North America and appointed an executive officer in January 2015, relocating from Hong Kong to New York; Mr. Bickley, President, International Group, was appointed an executive officer in January 2015.

0.15871465^0.7751429^Thus, the actual compensation realized by an NEO will be commensurate with our actual performance.
0.23395489^0.72942996^Thus, the awards vest in connection with a change in control only if the executive s employment is actually or constructively terminated within two years after a change in control.
0.18390027^0.72719556^Thus, the Named Executive Officers will realize value from their stock options only to the degree that Alaska Air Group s stockholders realize value, provided the stockholder had purchased shares and held them for the same period as the executive.

0.15413983^0.77592146^Thus, the total payout for this award for the NEOs, with the exception of Messrs. O Flynn and Da Santos who did not receive this award, was 48.7% of the original target number of shares as detailed in the following table:

0.30807966^0.8233869^To further this objective, our compensation programs seek to reward our Named Executive Officers and other executives for Coach s and their sustained high performance, to align compensation with the long-term interests of our stockholders and to attract and retain outstanding talent.

0.307216^0.8318486^To implement our philosophy, the executive compensation program is designed to be competitive with the programs of other companies with which the Company competes for talent, and to be fair and equitable to both the Company and the executives.

0.3063342^0.82936835^To reward both short and long-term performance and to further our compensation objectives, our executive compensation program is designed to:

0.3367103^0.7410565^To support the Company s specific fiscal year 2015 plans to forego promotional revenue and invest more heavily than in recent years in marketing and store renovation, the target values reflect sales, operating income and diluted EPS lower than the prior year.
0.37337554^0.7578293^To support the performance-based objectives of our compensation program, corporate and business unit goals and measures are established each year based on factors deemed necessary to achieve our financial and non-financial business objectives.

0.343062^0.8193063^To the extent necessary, the O&C Committee also works with other Board committees to review or approve reports, awards and other matters relating to compensation.
0.24243668^0.8268223^To the extent practicable and consistent with the objectives and underlying philosophy of our executive compensation program, the O&C Committee generally intends most components of executive compensation to qualify as tax deductible for federal income tax purposes.

0.30065596^0.7052326^To transition to the inclusion of Operating Metrics in performance awards, the Company also made awards based on Operating Metrics for the measurement periods 2014 and 2014-2015.

0.25005397^0.6804799^Together, the PRSU awards have a total grant date fair value of $1,016,644; at the maximum achievement level, the total grant date fair value would be $1,728,294.
0.2498085^0.6813934^Together, the two PRSU awards have a total grant date fair value of $1,499,989; at the maximum achievement level, the total grant date fair value would be $2,549,982.

0.3691653^0.8010173^When appropriate, the market data is size-adjusted, up or down, to accurately reflect comparable scopes of responsibilities.
0.37965095^0.75857913^When approving these goals the Board takes into account our business strategies, the economic environment and how the annual goal aligns with our long range plan.
0.2743333^0.8125679^When compared to our other NEOs, our CEO s total compensation is more heavily weighted towards incentive compensation and his stock ownership guideline is higher.
0.33970365^0.8231499^When considering an adjustment to a Senior Executive's base salary, the Compensation Committee reviews the Survey Data and evaluates the Senior Executive's position relative to the market, his/her level of responsibility and experience as well as overall Company performance.
0.36298817^0.7114121^When considering base salary adjustments for 2014, the Committee recognized that the Company s 2013 financial performance was below planned levels, and that our stock price declined in 2013 when many companies in our peer group and the S&P 500 experienced substantial growth.
0.2923084^0.7905673^When considering the competitive compensation data, the Compensation Committee targets the 75th percentile of the Reference Group for long-term incentives for our Senior Executives.
0.27308545^0.71386653^When deciding whether to award annual grants for that fiscal year, our Board considers collective performance.

0.28186134^0.788605^When determining base salaries, the Remuneration and Nomination Committee considers external market conditions in addition to total direct compensation targets.
0.31815052^0.7998291^When determining target executive pay, the Committee attempts to ensure that compensation is closely aligned with the overall strategy of the Company and that it motivates executives to achieve superior performance and stockholder returns.
0.35912687^0.73914385^When Effective
0.32916227^0.8048575^When it reviews compensation matters, the Committee considers the anticipated tax and accounting treatment of various payments and benefits to the Company and, when relevant, to the executive.
0.3665307^0.7105939^When making the adjustments, the Committee recognized that the Company s 2013 financial performance was below planned levels, and that our stock price declined in 2013 when many companies in our peer group and the S&P 500 experienced substantial growth.
0.335645^0.7802266^When making these adjustments, the Committee also noted the Company s performance in 2014, including the items discussed in  Executive Summary 2014 Company Performance  beginning on page 20.
0.2639841^0.80738413^When setting individual base salary levels, we consider several factors, including (i) the market reference point for the executive s position, (ii) the responsibilities of the executive s position, (iii) the experience and performance of the executive, and (iv) retention issues.
0.3607937^0.78838086^When setting these objectives, management and the O&C Committee determine the elements of our business that require the focused attention of the executives.
0.33943343^0.780437^When the Committee established these performance standards for the year, it retained discretion to adjust them for the effect of certain specified items.
0.33635846^0.7764349^When the Committee established this performance measure, it retained discretion to adjust income from continuing operations as reported in the Company s financial statements to ignore the effect of certain specified items (generally under the same categories identified above in the discussion of annual incentive compensation, and for the same reasons).
0.21919478^0.8881842^When the discount rate increases, the present value declines and when the discount rate decreases, the present value increases.
0.32876882^0.7923498^When the HR Committee and management are developing new or modified compensation programs and selecting performance measures for annual and long-term incentives risk taking is considered and affects decisions accordingly.
0.21157102^0.74342304^When the offer letter was negotiated, the Committee considered the importance to Applied of the success of the Varian transaction, the complexity of running the Varian business post-merger and the need for a strong leader to successfully integrate Varian into Applied.
0.24826804^0.7034354^When the stock price does not increase above the grant date price, neither the executive nor the stockholder realizes value.
0.33853075^0.6951925^While achievement of the other payout levels required increases of two cents per share, the Compensation Committee determined that achievement of the maximum payout level should require more of an increase.
0.24000072^0.7193322^while awards are generally made in relation to performance against specific goals, the Compensation Committee retains the discretion to adjust annual bonuses of cash and restricted stock as may be warranted by specific circumstances.
0.19185528^0.80096585^While each of these factors bore on the RNC s decisions regarding our NEOs  compensation, the RNC did not make any changes to our executive compensation program and policies as a result of the 2014  Say-on-Pay  advisory vote.
0.31874222^0.7368554^While each target is considered achievable, a superior level of performance was required to receive an award above the target level.
0.3275818^0.78108335^While goals are set for each measure below, the Compensation Committee approves a score based on its qualitative assessment.
0.3273229^0.7813455^While goals are set for each measure below, the Compensation Committee approves the score based on its qualitative assessment.
0.35755727^0.71580344^While in previous years the Company s total shareholder return was measured relative to two peer groups (a custom peer group and the Philadelphia Utility Index), the Compensation Committee decided to streamline the performance share peer group for the 2014 grant by eliminating the Philadelphia Utility Index and establishing one custom peer group.
0.32316238^0.73809177^While targets when set are considered achievable, a superior level of performance is required to receive an award above the target level.
0.31928352^0.76864326^While the AICP rewards Senior Executives for the achievement of specific formulaic financial measures, the Compensation Committee utilizes a performance scorecard to reward Senior Executives based upon the Compensation Committee's assessment of the achievement of specific performance goals that are critical to the execution of the Company's strategy, but may or may not be formulaic in nature.
0.2944638^0.79101866^While the Committee attempts to base compensation decisions on the most recent market data available, it also recognizes the importance of flexibility, and may go above or below the market median for any individual or for any specific element of compensation.
0.32287163^0.7916514^While the Committee does not use a specific formula to determine the allocation between performance-based and fixed compensation, it does review the total compensation and competitive benchmarking when determining such allocation.
0.30751008^0.81754243^While the Committee had a favorable view of Management s performance in light of these circumstances, the Committee nevertheless noted that the Company s financial results were at the middle or lower end of the Company s estimates, which had a significant impact on Annual Incentive Payments as compared to the target award and the prior year award for each Named Executive.
0.24137047^0.8256649^While the Compensation Committee generally intends to structure and administer our stockholder-approved compensation plans so as not to be subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Compensation Committee may, where it believes it is in the best interests of our stockholders and to remain competitive in the marketplace for talent, approve awards or payments that cannot be deducted in order to maintain flexibility in structuring appropriate compensation programs.
0.18102553^0.7296847^While the executive officers are given five years to meet the applicable stock ownership guidelines, the Compensation Committee monitors participation and expects that incremental progress will be made each year by each executive officer who has not met the applicable guidelines.
0.33021647^0.7877759^While the measures for evaluating the Senior Executives' performance with respect to the performance goals are subject to the Compensation Committee's discretion, the Compensation Committee and the Company establish performance scorecard goals and specific expectations related to the achievement of these goals at the beginning of each year.
0.2968348^0.8274485^While the programs and pay levels reflect differences in job responsibilities, the structure of the compensation and benefits program is applied consistently to our Named Executive Officers, including the CEO.
0.2381408^0.82607603^While the RNC is mindful of the benefit to the Company of the full deductibility of compensation, the committee believes that the requirements of Section 162(m) should not impair its flexibility in compensating our NEOs in a manner that can best promote the Company s objectives.
0.32582125^0.83735555^While the Say on Pay votes are advisory and not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee strongly values the opinions of the stockholders as expressed in the Say on Pay votes.
0.1791995^0.76702046^While the secondary performance goals are shared by all NEOs, the IPF is based on performance against personal objectives established at the beginning of the year for NEOs other than Mr. Dickerson and Mr. Splinter.
0.16774496^0.7681422^While the secondary performance goals were the same for all NEOs, the weightings of certain goals varied among the NEOs to reflect their influence over both Applied s overall performance and their individual business units and functions.
0.30194438^0.8143227^While there is no direct link to performance once an executive officer becomes a participant, the annual accrual is based on the executive officer s position as well as the current year s base salary and bonus payments, which are directly linked to performance, as discussed above.

0.3097369^0.6948824^With a significant portion of the executive officer s annual grant LTI mix (75% PSUs/25% PBRSUs) contingent on relative performance versus the retail peer group, a focus of this year s annual review was to broaden the view of the competitive landscape in assessing relative performance under the PSU and PBRSU plans, as well as assessing the executive officer s compensation levels.
0.3279816^0.81583667^With consideration to the above changes, we believe we have responded to all substantive feedback received from stockholders and proxy advisors and that Coach s executive compensation programs have been designed to effectively achieve the Board s objectives and the Company s long-term strategic plan.
0.1741954^0.7535486^With respect to 2014 compensation for the NEOs, the stock option grants under the 1993 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan have been structured to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m).
0.252638^0.71152896^With respect to each of these executives, the Committee approved awards that were calculated by deducting the equity grant value the executive received at the annual grant made in February from the equity grant value he would have received at the increased equity award target (and, in the case of Mr. Harrison and Mr. Sprague, the increased base salary) for the portion of the year he would serve in the more responsible role.
