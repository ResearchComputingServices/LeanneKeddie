0.29267722^0.8080592^The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly reviews the current composition and size of the Board
0.30459204^0.800055^The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any third-party search firm to identify director candidates, and has the authority to approve the fees and retention terms of such search firm
0.2817065^0.62950814^Table of Contents The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee s criteria and process for evaluating and identifying the candidates that it selects, or recommends to the full Board for selection, as director nominees are as follows:
0.22787383^0.9259807^In its evaluation of director candidates, including the members of the Board eligible for re-election, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board
0.26957467^0.8529018^The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers: (1) the current size and composition of the Board and the needs of the Board and its committees; (2) such factors as character, judgment, diversity, age, expertise, business experience, length of service, independence, and other commitments; (3) relationships between directors and Autodesk's customers and suppliers; and (4) such other factors as the Committee may consider appropriate
0.30559388^0.84435403^With regard to candidates who are properly recommended by stockholders or by other means, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will review the qualifications of any such candidate, which review may, in the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee s discretion, include interviewing references, direct interviews with the candidate, or other actions the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee deems necessary or proper
0.2664856^0.8446686^While the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for director candidates, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes that candidates and nominees must reflect a Board that comprises directors who (1) are predominantly independent; (2) have high integrity; (3) have broad, business-related knowledge and experience at the policy-making level in business or technology, including their understanding of the software industry and Autodesk's business in particular; (4) have qualifications that will increase overall Board effectiveness; (5) have varied and divergent experiences, viewpoints and backgrounds; and (6) meet other requirements as may be required by applicable rules, such as financial literacy or financial expertise with respect to audit committee members
0.2986965^0.8656044^In executing the responsibilities set forth in its charter, the Committee relies on a number of resources to provide input to the decision-making process
0.29096392^0.85117424^The CEO bases his evaluation on his knowledge of each executive officer s performance and from others with knowledge of their performance, including feedback provided by the executive officers and their direct reports
0.30685017^0.86620855^The Committee also consults with management and Autodesk s Human Resources Group regarding executive and non- executive employee compensation plans, including administration of Autodesk s equity incentive plans
0.9927635^0.50006676^Competitive Compensation Positioning To ensure our executive compensation practices are competitive and consistent with the Committee s guiding principles, Exequity and management provide the Committee with compensation data for each executive role
0.9682919^0.5039573^Exequity provided advice and recommendations on many issues: total compensation philosophy; program design, including program goals, components, and metrics; compensation trends in the high technology sector and general market for senior executives; and the compensation of the CEO and the other executive officers
0.969192^0.5069349^The Committee has considered the independence of Exequity in light of NASDAQ's listing standards for compensation committee independence and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
0.277542^0.85286283^The Committee believes that referencing the total compensation packages of the companies in the compensation peer group keeps Autodesk s compensation competitive and within market norms, while also providing flexibility for variances in compensation where appropriate, based on each executive officer s leadership, contributions and particular skills or expertise
0.3093656^0.52075255^At the beginning of the fiscal year, the Committee established funding performance thresholds, which, if achieved, would establish maximum Fiscal 2016 EIP funding at 190% of target
0.30368006^0.44089052^This calculation yielded a bonus payout of 100.6% of target, as shown below:        Weighting        Actual Target Payout        Multiplier          Billings 56% 4.7%  growth 5.2%  growth 99.5%   Subscriptions 24% 2.578 million 2.634 million 97.9%   Deferred Revenue 20%        $1.519 billion               $1.423 billion        106.8%   Total 100%   100.6% For the other NEOs, the Committee assessed the performance of the Company based 70% on billings and 30% on subscriptions against targets set at the beginning of the fiscal year; the final award could range from 0% to 150% of target award, depending on achieved performance level

0.29444343^0.8623105^In addition to GAV, Aimco also reviews other factors, including gross revenues, number  of apartment communities, and number of employees, to determine if these factors provide any additional insight into the size and complexity factors of its analysis
0.28548476^0.53287673^One hundred percent of Mr. Considine s STI, and 50% of the STI for the other NEOs, is based upon Aimco s performance against its corporate goals
0.2637665^0.8079393^Risk analysis of Aimco s compensation programs   The  Committee  considers  risk-related  issues  when  making  decisions  with  respect  to  executive  compensation  and  has  determined that  neither  Aimco s  executive compensation program nor any of its non-executive compensation programs create risk-taking incentives that are reasonably likely to  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the organization
0.3072284^0.50668156^For the other NEOs, calculation of STI is determined by the following two components, each representing  50%  of  the  target  STI: Aimco s  performance  against  the KPI;  and  each  individual  officer s  achievement  of  his  or  her  MAP goals
0.302452^0.4430293^(1) 30% based on 2015 conventional same-store NOI performance;         (2) 5% based on resident satisfaction scores;   Portfolio Management (12.5% of KPI):     (3) 12.5% based on acquisition and sales activity;   Redevelopment and Development (12.5% of KPI):   (4) 12.5% based on redevelopment and development investment and returns;   Balance Sheet (10% of KPI):     (5) 5% based on leverage ratios;         (6) 5% based on improving credit ratings;   Business and Culture (30% of KPI):     (7) 25% based on AFFO per share; and         (8) 5% based on team member engagement scores
0.31101447^0.35172507^If KPI results are 75%, then the executive receives 75% of $200,000 ($150,000) for that portion of his STI, and if MAP results are 100%, then the executive receives 100% of the $200,000, for a total STI payment of  $350,000
0.30896148^0.34149596^For  example,  if  an  executive s target  STI  is  $400,000,  then  50%  of  that  amount,  or  $200,000, varies  based  on  KPI  results  and  50%  of  that  amount,  or  $200,000,  varies based on MAP results

0.29315603^0.44859335^For 2015,  Aimco s resident satisfaction score, from approximately 77,000 survey responses, was 4.15, resulting in a payout of 10% for each of the NEOs
