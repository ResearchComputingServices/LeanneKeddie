0.009977907^0.30364046^The Compensation Committee measures our safety performance through a combination of components: Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR"), Total Potential Severity Rate ("TPSR") and Process Safety.

0.011354715^0.286586^Together, the safety metric outcomes resulted in a formulaic payout percentage for this measure of 38% of the total target bonus opportunity for each of the Named Executive Officers in 2014.
0.009448081^0.30526504^TRIR is a safety performance metric recognized by the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration and is used by companies across an array of different industries.
0.009354383^0.30541366^We calculate TRIR based upon the guidelines set forth by the International Association of Drilling Contractors (the "IADC"), an industry group for the drilling industry.
0.009744942^0.30522284^The IADC methodology calculates TRIR by taking the aggregate number of occurrences of work-related injuries or illnesses that result in any of the following: fatality; a physician or licensed health care professional recommending days away from work due to the injury or illness; an employee not being able to perform all of his or her routine job functions (but not resulting in days away from work); or any other medical care or treatment beyond minor first aid.
0.0088685155^0.30557618^The TRIR is the number of such occurrences for every 200,000 employee hours worked.
0.008824855^0.3052718^The Compensation Committee approved a TRIR target for 2014 of .64, which would represent further progress toward our safety vision.
0.006934315^0.3065307^Any TRIR outcome representing a shortfall of more than 20% as compared to the target would result in a 0% bonus payout for the TRIR metric and any outcome representing an improvement of 20% or greater as compared to the target would result in a payout of 200% for the TRIR metric.
0.007072091^0.30642608^Our TRIR outcome for 2014 was .54, representing an improvement of just under 20% as compared to target.
0.006903827^0.30659616^This resulted in a formulaic result of 178% of target for the TRIR metric.
0.010406256^0.30446434^TPSR is an internally developed safety measure that we utilize to capture the potential severity of incidents over a period of time.
0.010154158^0.30450666^TPSR is calculated by taking the sum of all potential severity values assigned to the incidents, multiplying that number by 200,000, then dividing that number by total employee hours worked.
0.009927154^0.30384254^After the occurrence of an incident, the manager(s) responsible for the drilling unit or onshore facility where the incident took place complete an incident report that assigns a preliminary severity value to the incident.
0.009039432^0.30355963^The Company also has an independent oversight and review process to evaluate and confirm the potential severity assigned to each incident.
0.0099692345^0.30335543^The severity value is derived by inputting data into our comprehensive severity calculator.
0.011475831^0.30422917^For instance, for dropped objects, the height from which the item was dropped and the weight of the object are inputs into the severity calculator.

0.006962776^0.30667132^Any TPSR outcome representing a shortfall of more than 20% as compared to the target would result in a 0% bonus payout for the TPSR metric and any outcome representing an improvement of 20% or greater as compared to the target would result in a payout of 200% for the TPSR metric.
0.0068991184^0.3065674^Our TPSR outcome for 2014 of 30.88 represented close to a 20% shortfall as compared to the target.

0.010403693^0.3046956^During 2014, the company experienced a reduction in the number of recordable work related injuries or illnesses, leading to positive results reflected in TRIR; however, in reviewing our recordable safety incidents, we identified an increased prevalence of potential severity, leading to the weak TPSR result noted above.
0.020101726^0.30016136^Consistent with our commitment to safety, improving incident severity will be a point of focus for the Company in 2015.
