0.66584706^0.35470653^In its evaluation of director candidates, including the members of the Board eligible for re-election, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience and capability on the Board

0.68516755^0.42138067^While the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for director candidates, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes that candidates and nominees must reflect a Board that comprises directors who (1) are predominantly independent; (2) have high integrity; (3) have broad, business-related knowledge and experience at the policy-making level in business or technology, including their understanding of the software industry and Autodesk's business in particular; (4) have qualifications that will increase overall Board effectiveness; (5) have varied and divergent experiences, viewpoints and backgrounds; and (6) meet other requirements as may be required by applicable rules, such as financial literacy or financial expertise with respect to audit committee members
0.6656334^0.35271838^In executing the responsibilities set forth in its charter, the Committee relies on a number of resources to provide input to the decision-making process

0.6932435^0.30732766^Exequity provided advice and recommendations on many issues: total compensation philosophy; program design, including program goals, components, and metrics; compensation trends in the high technology sector and general market for senior executives; and the compensation of the CEO and the other executive officers

0.70620346^0.35604402^The Committee believes that referencing the total compensation packages of the companies in the compensation peer group keeps Autodesk s compensation competitive and within market norms, while also providing flexibility for variances in compensation where appropriate, based on each executive officer s leadership, contributions and particular skills or expertise

0.51546144^0.2994429^(1) 30% based on 2015 conventional same-store NOI performance;         (2) 5% based on resident satisfaction scores;   Portfolio Management (12.5% of KPI):     (3) 12.5% based on acquisition and sales activity;   Redevelopment and Development (12.5% of KPI):   (4) 12.5% based on redevelopment and development investment and returns;   Balance Sheet (10% of KPI):     (5) 5% based on leverage ratios;         (6) 5% based on improving credit ratings;   Business and Culture (30% of KPI):     (7) 25% based on AFFO per share; and         (8) 5% based on team member engagement scores

0.6738122^0.24630103^For  example,  if  an  executive s target  STI  is  $400,000,  then  50%  of  that  amount,  or  $200,000, varies  based  on  KPI  results  and  50%  of  that  amount,  or  $200,000,  varies based on MAP results

0.6827593^0.25675565^The Committee, in consultation with management, decided that continuing base salary amounts from fiscal 2014 met the goal of sufficiently recognizing executives for their time and serv- ice, was sufficiently competitive to provide adequate retention value and allowed Applied to continue its focus on weighting cash compensation toward performance-based incentives
0.70847106^0.24220318^At the beginning of fiscal 2015, the Committee increased Mr. Dickerson s salary from $980,000 to $1,000,000 and Mr. Halliday s from $575,000 to $625,000 in recognition of their strong performance and based on the data provided by Semler Brossy regarding market positioning of the execu- tives  overall targeted total direct compensation

0.71757793^0.08067532^For fiscal 2015, in developing the corporate scorecard goals and their weightings that were recommended to the Commit- tee, management considered the importance of shared goals for all the NEOs, and analyzed the relative importance of each goal to Applied s business strategy and the anticipated difficulty of achieving the goals in the aggregate
0.7125419^0.10199538^At the end of fiscal 2015, Mr. Dickerson recommended, and the Committee approved, the IPF ratings for the other NEOs, which  ranged  from  95%  to  120%
0.719368^0.08820571^While it was of paramount importance to retain the NEOs at that time, the Committee, in consultation with management, determined that the fiscal 2015 target grant sizes provided sufficient performance- based equity incentives to align compensation with the long- term interests of our stockholders, were in line with market norms for the NEOs  respective roles and were sufficient to provide retention incentive for them
0.63075495^0.15264893^Similarly, Applied has not timed, nor does it intend to time, the release of material, nonpublic information based on equity award grant dates
0.71492714^0.45420316^In formulating its compensation recommendations for fiscal 2015, management considered data primarily from a survey conducted by Radford Survey + Consulting, as well as publicly-available information about the peer group provided by Semler Brossy

0.7148801^0.45602977^For fiscal 2015, the Committee engaged Semler Brossy Consulting Group ( Semler Brossy ) as its independent executive compensation consultant
0.71357274^0.45589513^The Committee typically asks Semler Brossy to attend the Committee s meetings, including executive sessions at which management is not present

0.650388^0.24941307^We fashioned various components of our 2015 compensation payments and awards to meet these objectives as follows:   Type of Compensation         Objectives Addressed Salary      Competitive Compensation Short-Term Incentive Awards, Restricted Stock Awards and Stock Option Grants      Competitive Compensation, Performance Incentives, Stakeholder Incentives and Retention Incentives Determination of Competitive Compensation In assessing the competitiveness of our compensation levels, we review current-year compensation data provided to us by an independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC.
0.69681746^0.36987573^The compensation consultant advised us that it used general industry data rather than data relating only to electronics and electronic component companies because general industry data provides a much larger sampling of companies, and does not differ meaningfully from the data produced by an electronics and electronic component subset
0.7010959^0.35643774^In considering the data provided by the compensation consultant, we believe that compensation is competitive if it is within a range of 20 percent above or 20 percent below the compensation reference points at the 50  percentile for comparable executives
0.5607694^0.19839628^Payment amounts increase from 0 percent to 200 percent of the target award in proportion to the increase from 3 percentage points below target (threshold) to 3 percentage points above target (maximum) of the organic revenue growth goal and in proportion to the decrease from 110 percent (threshold) to 90 percent (maximum) of the working capital goal
0.5604949^0.19993064^Payment amounts increase from 0 percent to 200 percent of the target award in proportion to the increase from 80 percent (threshold) to 110 percent (maximum) of the goal attainment with regard to each measure except for organic revenue growth and working capital
