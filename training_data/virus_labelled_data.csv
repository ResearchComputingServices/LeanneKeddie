BIO,"A virus is a tiny infectious agent that reproduces inside the cells of living hosts."
BIO,"When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus."
BIO,"Unlike most living things, viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses assemble in the infected host cell."
BIO,"But unlike simpler infectious agents like prions, they contain genes, which allow them to mutate and evolve."
BIO,"Over 4,800 species of viruses have been described in detail out of the millions in the environment."
BIO,"Their origin is unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria."
BIO,"Viruses are made of either two or three parts."
BIO,"All include genes."
BIO,"These genes contain the encoded biological information of the virus and are built from either DNA or RNA."
BIO,"All viruses are also covered with a protein coat to protect the genes."
BIO,"Some viruses may also have an envelope of fat-like substance that covers the protein coat, and makes them vulnerable to soap."
BIO,"A virus with this "viral envelope" uses it—along with specific receptors—to enter a new host cell."
BIO,"Viruses vary in shape from the simple helical and icosahedral to more complex structures."
BIO,"Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 nanometres; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to 1 centimetre (0.4 in)."
BIO,"Viruses spread in many ways."
BIO,"Although many are very specific about which host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method to copy itself."
BIO,"Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors."
BIO,"Some viruses of humans and other animals are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids."
BIO,"Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze."
BIO,"Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water."
BIO,"Rotavirus is often spread by direct contact with infected children."
BIO,"The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex."
BIO,"Others, such as the dengue virus, are spread by blood-sucking insects."
BIO,"Viruses, especially those made of RNA, can mutate rapidly to give rise to new types."
BIO,"Hosts may have little protection against such new forms."
BIO,"Influenza virus, for example, changes often, so a new vaccine is needed each year."
BIO,"Major changes can cause pandemics, as in the 2009 swine influenza that spread to most countries."
BIO,"Often, these mutations take place when the virus has first infected other animal hosts."
BIO,"Some examples of such "zoonotic" diseases include coronavirus in bats, and influenza in pigs and birds, before those viruses were transferred to humans."
BIO,"Viral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and plants."
BIO,"In healthy humans and animals, infections are usually eliminated by the immune system, which can provide lifetime immunity to the host for that virus."
BIO,"Antibiotics, which work against bacteria, have no impact, but antiviral drugs can treat life-threatening infections."
BIO,"Those vaccines that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some infections."
BIO,"In 1884, French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented the Chamberland filter (or Chamberland–Pasteur filter), that contains pores smaller than bacteria."
BIO,"He could then pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter, and completely remove them."
BIO,"In the early 1890s, Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this method to study what became known as the tobacco mosaic virus."
BIO,"His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration."
BIO,"At the same time, several other scientists showed that, although these agents (later called viruses) were different from bacteria and about one hundred times smaller, they could still cause disease."
BIO,"In 1899, Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck observed that the agent only multiplied when in dividing cells."
BIO,"He called it a "contagious living fluid" (Latin: contagium vivum fluidum)—or a "soluble living germ" because he could not find any germ-like particles."
BIO,"In the early 20th century, English bacteriologist Frederick Twort discovered viruses that infect bacteria, and French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on agar, would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria."
BIO,"Counting these dead areas allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the suspension."
BIO,"The invention of the electron microscope in 1931 brought the first images of viruses."
BIO,"In 1935, American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and found it to be mainly made from protein."
BIO,"A short time later, this virus was shown to be made from protein and RNA."
BIO,"Rosalind Franklin developed X-ray crystallographic pictures and determined the full structure of TMV in 1955."
BIO,"Franklin confirmed that viral proteins formed a spiral hollow tube, wrapped by RNA, and also showed that viral RNA was a single strand, not a double helix like DNA."
BIO,"A problem for early scientists was that they did not know how to grow viruses without using live animals."
BIO,"The breakthrough came in 1931, when American pathologists Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza, and several other viruses, in fertilised chickens' eggs."
BIO,"Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs."
BIO,"This problem was solved in 1949, when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller, and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells."
BIO,"Over 4,800 species of viruses have been described in detail."
BIO,"Viruses co-exist with life wherever it occurs."
BIO,"They have probably existed since living cells first evolved."
BIO,"Their origin remains unclear because they do not fossilize, so molecular techniques have been the best way to hypothesise about how they arose."
BIO,"These techniques rely on the availability of ancient viral DNA or RNA, but most viruses that have been preserved and stored in laboratories are less than 90 years old."
BIO,"Molecular methods have only been successful in tracing the ancestry of viruses that evolved in the 20th century."
BIO,"New groups of viruses might have repeatedly emerged at all stages of the evolution of life."
BIO,"There are three major theories about the origins of viruses:"
BIO,"Viruses may have once been small cells that parasitised larger cells."
BIO,"Eventually, the genes they no longer needed for a parasitic way of life were lost."
BIO,"The bacteria Rickettsia and Chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells."
BIO,"This lends credence to this theory, as their dependence on being parasites may have led to the loss of the genes that once allowed them to live on their own."
BIO,"Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that "escaped" from the genes of a larger organism."
BIO,"The escaped DNA could have come from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria."
BIO,"Viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and DNA at the same time as cells first appeared on earth, and would have depended on cellular life for many millions of years."
BIO,"There are problems with all of these theories."
BIO,"The regressive hypothesis does not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way."
BIO,"The escape or the cellular origin hypothesis does not explain the presence of unique structures in viruses that do not appear in cells."
BIO,"The coevolution, or "virus-first" hypothesis, conflicts with the definition of viruses, because viruses depend on host cells."
BIO,"Also, viruses are recognised as ancient, and to have origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains."
BIO,"This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses."
BIO,"A virus particle, also called a virion, consists of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid."
BIO,"The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules called capsomers."
BIO,"The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical, or more complex."
BIO,"There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, made out of proteins."
BIO,"Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope, which makes them vulnerable to soap and alcohol."
BIO,"Viruses are among the smallest infectious agents, and are too small to be seen by light microscopy; most of them can only be seen by electron microscopy."
BIO,"Their sizes range from 20 to 300 nanometres; it would take 30,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to one centimetre (0.4 in)."
BIO,"In comparison, bacteria are typically around 1000 nanometres (1 micrometer) in diameter, and host cells of higher organisms are typically a few tens of micrometers."
BIO,"Some viruses such as megaviruses and pandoraviruses are relatively large viruses."
BIO,"At around 1000 nanometres, these viruses, which infect amoebae, were discovered in 2003 and 2013."
BIO,"They are around ten times wider (and thus a thousand times larger in volume) than influenza viruses, and the discovery of these "giant" viruses astonished scientists."
BIO,"The genes of viruses are made from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid)."
BIO,"The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA or RNA."
BIO,"Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as their genetic material."
BIO,"The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix."
BIO,"Viruses can reproduce rapidly because they have relatively few genes."
BIO,"For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven."
BIO,"In comparison, humans have 20,000–25,000."
BIO,"Some viral genes contain the code to make the structural proteins that form the virus particle."
BIO,"Other genes make non-structural proteins found only in the cells the virus infects."
BIO,"All cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are enzymes that drive chemical reactions."
BIO,"Some of these enzymes, called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase, make new copies of DNA and RNA."
BIO,"A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the equivalent enzymes of the host cells, but viral RNA polymerase enzymes are error-prone, causing RNA viruses to mutate and form new strains."
BIO,"In some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated."
BIO,"The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA."
BIO,"When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called reassortment."
BIO,"Proteins are essential to life."
BIO,"Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA."
BIO,"Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein."
BIO,"Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce."
BIO,"Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation."
BIO,"Transcription is the process where information in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called messenger RNA (mRNA)."
BIO,"These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where it is used to make proteins."
BIO,"This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code."
BIO,"Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids."
BIO,"Some nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification."
BIO,"For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses."
BIO,"In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA."
BIO,"These are called negative-sense RNA viruses."
BIO,"In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell."
BIO,"The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase."
BIO,"This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways."
BIO,"When a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses."
BIO,"It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles."
BIO,"There are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:"
BIO,"Attachment is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell."
BIO,"This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell."
BIO,"For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface."
BIO,"Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals."
BIO,"This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing."
BIO,"Penetration follows attachment; viruses penetrate the host cell by endocytosis or by fusion with the cell."
BIO,"Uncoating happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid."
BIO,"Replication of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins."
BIO,"The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA."
BIO,"Assembly takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles."
BIO,"Release occurs when the new viruses escape or are released from the cell."
BIO,"Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called lysis."
BIO,"Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called budding."
BIO,"Viruses have an extensive range of structural and biochemical effects on the host cell.These are called cytopathic effects."
BIO,"Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell."
BIO,"The causes of death include cell lysis (bursting), alterations to the cell's surface membrane and apoptosis (cell "suicide")."
BIO,"Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activity due to proteins produced by the virus, not all of which are components of the virus particle."
BIO,"Some viruses cause no apparent changes to the infected cell."
BIO,"Cells in which the virus is latent (inactive) show few signs of infection and often function normally."
BIO,"This causes persistent infections and the virus is often dormant for many months or years."
BIO,"This is often the case with herpes viruses."
BIO,"Some viruses, such as Epstein–Barr virus, often cause cells to proliferate without causing malignancy; but some other viruses, such as papillomavirus, are an established cause of cancer."
BIO,"When a cell's DNA is damaged by a virus such that the cell cannot repair itself, this often triggers apoptosis."
BIO,"One of the results of apoptosis is destruction of the damaged DNA by the cell itself."
BIO,"Some viruses have mechanisms to limit apoptosis so that the host cell does not die before progeny viruses have been produced; HIV, for example, does this."
BIO,"There are many ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two."
BIO,"Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors."
BIO,"Some viruses that infect animals, including humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects, but direct transmission is more common."
BIO,"Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, by hands and communal objects, and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses are airborne."
BIO,"Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles."
BIO,"To prevent infections and epidemics, it is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread."
BIO,"Common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox and cold sores."
BIO,"Serious diseases such as Ebola and AIDS are also caused by viruses."
BIO,"Many viruses cause little or no disease and are said to be "benign"."
BIO,"The more harmful viruses are described as virulent."
BIO,"Viruses cause different diseases depending on the types of cell that they infect."
BIO,"Some viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections where the viruses continue to reproduce in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms."
BIO,"This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections."
BIO,"People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers."
BIO,"They serve as important reservoirs of the virus."
BIO,"If the proportion of carriers in a given population reaches a given threshold, a disease is said to be endemic."
BIO,"Before the advent of vaccination, infections with viruses were common and outbreaks occurred regularly."
BIO,"In countries with a temperate climate, viral diseases are usually seasonal."
BIO,"Poliomyelitis, caused by poliovirus often occurred in the summer months."
BIO,"By contrast colds, influenza and rotavirus infections are usually a problem during the winter months."
BIO,"Other viruses, such as measles virus, caused outbreaks regularly every third year."
BIO,"In developing countries, viruses that cause respiratory and enteric infections are common throughout the year."
BIO,"Viruses carried by insects are a common cause of diseases in these settings."
BIO,"Zika and dengue viruses for example are transmitted by the female Aedes mosquitoes, which bite humans particularly during the mosquitoes' breeding season."
BIO,"Although viral pandemics are rare events, HIV—which evolved from viruses found in monkeys and chimpanzees—has been pandemic since at least the 1980s."
BIO,"During the 20th century there were four pandemics caused by influenza virus and those that occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968 were severe."
BIO,"Before its eradication, smallpox was a cause of pandemics for more than 3,000 years."
BIO,"Throughout history, human migration has aided the spread of pandemic infections; first by sea and in modern times also by air."
BIO,"With the exception of smallpox, most pandemics are caused by newly evolved viruses."
BIO,"These "emergent" viruses are usually mutants of less harmful viruses that have circulated previously either in humans or in other animals."
BIO,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are caused by new types of coronaviruses."
BIO,"Other coronaviruses are known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of SARS infections—that by July 2003 had caused around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths—was unexpected and most countries were not prepared."
BIO,"A related coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 and spread rapidly around the world."
BIO,"Thought to have originated in bats and subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, infections with the virus cause a disease called COVID-19, that varies in severity from mild to deadly, and led to a pandemic in 2020."
BIO,"Restrictions unprecedented in peacetime were placed on international travel, and curfews imposed in several major cities worldwide."
BIO,"There are many types of plant virus, but often they only cause a decrease in yield, and it is not economically viable to try to control them."
BIO,"Plant viruses are frequently spread from plant to plant by organisms called "vectors"."
BIO,"These are normally insects, but some fungi, nematode worms and single-celled organisms have also been shown to be vectors."
BIO,"When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds."
BIO,"Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells."
BIO,"Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and archaea."
BIO,"They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth."
BIO,"Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily."
BIO,"These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria."
BIO,"Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans."
BIO,"Animals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses."
BIO,"Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type."
BIO,"This innate immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a "memory" of the infection."
BIO,"The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host."
BIO,"The acidity of the contents of the stomach destroys many viruses that have been swallowed."
BIO,"When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body."
BIO,"A special hormone called interferon is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cells and their close neighbours."
BIO,"Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses."
BIO,"This is called RNA interference."
BIO,"Some blood cells engulf and destroy other virus-infected cells."
BIO,"Specific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called lymphocytes play a central role."
BIO,"Lymphocytes retain a "memory" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called antibodies."
BIO,"These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells."
BIO,"Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus."
BIO,"The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection."
BIO,"After the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, usually giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus."
BIO,"Plants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses."
BIO,"One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes."
BIO,"Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots."
BIO,"This stops the infection from spreading."
BIO,"RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants."
BIO,"When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that destroy viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen molecules."
BIO,"The major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA."
BIO,"These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells."
BIO,"Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease."
BIO,"Their use has resulted in the eradication of smallpox and a dramatic decline in illness and death caused by infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella."
BIO,"Vaccines are available to prevent over fourteen viral infections of humans and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals."
BIO,"Vaccines may consist of either live or killed viruses."
BIO,"Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, but these vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with weak immunity."
BIO,"In these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease."
BIO,"Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce "designer" vaccines that only have the capsid proteins of the virus."
BIO,"Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine."
BIO,"These vaccines are safer because they can never cause the disease."
BIO,"Since the mid-1980s, the development of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the AIDS pandemic."
BIO,"Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which masquerade as DNA building blocks (nucleosides)."
BIO,"When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of the fake building blocks are used."
BIO,"This prevents DNA replication because the drugs lack the essential features that allow the formation of a DNA chain."
BIO,"When DNA production stops the virus can no longer reproduce."
BIO,"Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections."
BIO,"Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs."
BIO,"Other antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle."
BIO,"HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the HIV-1 protease for the virus to become infectious."
BIO,"There is a class of drugs called protease inhibitors, which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning."
BIO,"Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus."
BIO,"In 80% of those infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain infectious for the rest of their lives unless they are treated."
BIO,"There are effective treatments that use direct-acting antivirals."
BIO,"Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus have been developed by a similar strategy, using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs."
BIO,"In both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells."
BIO,"HIV infections are usually treated with a combination of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life cycle."
BIO,"There are drugs that prevent the virus from attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce."
BIO,"The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce."
BIO,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments; one teaspoon of seawater contains about ten million viruses, and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems."
BIO,"Most are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals."
BIO,"They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and this is the most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment."
BIO,"The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth."
BIO,"Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea."
BIO,"It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea."
BIO,"They are mainly responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life."
BIO,"The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms."
BIO,"Their effects are far-reaching; by increasing the amount of respiration in the oceans, viruses are indirectly responsible for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by approximately 3 gigatonnes of carbon per year."
BIO,"Marine mammals are also susceptible to viral infections."
BIO,"In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper virus."
BIO,"Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations."
BIO,"Viruses can also serve as an alternative food source for microorganisms which engage in virovory, supplying nucleic acids, nitrogen, and phosphorus through their consumption."
BIO,"A virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism."
BIO,"Viruses infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea."
BIO,"Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most numerous type of biological entity."
BIO,"Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article describing a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants and the discovery of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, more than 11,000 of the millions of virus species have been described in detail."
BIO,"The study of viruses is known as virology, a subspeciality of microbiology."
BIO,"When infected, a host cell is often forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus."
BIO,"When not inside an infected cell or in the process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent viral particles, or virions, consisting of"
BIO,"(i) genetic material, i.e., long molecules of DNA or RNA that encode the structure of the proteins by which the virus acts;"
BIO,"(ii) a protein coat, the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases"
BIO,"(iii) an outside envelope of lipids."
BIO,"The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms to more complex structures."
BIO,"Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an optical microscope and are one-hundredth the size of most bacteria."
BIO,"The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are still unclear."
BIO,"Some viruses may have evolved from plasmids, which are pieces of DNA that can move between cells."
BIO,"Other viruses may have evolved from bacteria."
BIO,"In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction."
BIO,"Viruses are considered by some biologists to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection, although they lack the key characteristics, such as cell structure, that are generally considered necessary criteria for defining life."
BIO,"Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as "organisms at the edge of life" and as replicators."
BIO,"Viruses spread in many ways."
BIO,"One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as vectors: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on plant sap, such as aphids; and viruses in animals can be carried by blood-sucking insects."
BIO,"Many viruses spread in the air by coughing and sneezing, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, chickenpox, smallpox, and measles."
BIO,"Norovirus and rotavirus, common causes of viral gastroenteritis, are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, passed by hand-to-mouth contact or in food or water."
BIO,"The infectious dose of norovirus required to produce infection in humans is fewer than 100 particles."
BIO,"HIV is one of several viruses transmitted through sexual contact and by exposure to infected blood."
BIO,"The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its host range: this is narrow for viruses specialized to infect only a few species, or broad for viruses capable of infecting many."
BIO,"Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus."
BIO,"Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection."
BIO,"Some viruses, including those that cause HIV/AIDS, HPV infection, and viral hepatitis, evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections."
BIO,"Several classes of antiviral drugs have been developed."
BIO,"Viruses are found wherever there is life and have probably existed since living cells first evolved."
BIO,"The origin of viruses is unclear because they do not form fossils, so molecular techniques are used to infer how they arose."
BIO,"In addition, viral genetic material occasionally integrates into the germline of the host organisms, by which they can be passed on vertically to the offspring of the host for many generations."
BIO,"This provides an invaluable source of information for paleovirologists to trace back ancient viruses that existed as far back as millions of years ago."
BIO,"There are three main hypotheses that aim to explain the origins of viruses:"
BIO,"Viruses may have once been small cells that parasitised larger cells."
BIO,"Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost."
BIO,"The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells."
BIO,"They lend support to this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism is likely to have caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell."
BIO,"This is also called the 'degeneracy hypothesis', or 'reduction hypothesis'."
BIO,"Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that "escaped" from the genes of a larger organism."
BIO,"The escaped DNA could have come from plasmids (pieces of naked DNA that can move between cells) or transposons (molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions within the genes of the cell)."
BIO,"Once called jumping genes, transposons are examples of mobile genetic elements and could be the origin of some viruses."
BIO,"They were discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in 1950."
BIO,"This is sometimes called the 'vagrancy hypothesis', or the 'escape hypothesis'."
BIO,"This is also called the 'virus-first hypothesis' and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid at the same time that cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years."
BIO,"Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat."
BIO,"They have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents."
BIO,"Viroids are important pathogens of plants."
BIO,"They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication."
BIO,"The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own."
BIO,"It is, therefore, a defective virus."
BIO,"Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells."
BIO,"In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii."
BIO,"These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called 'satellites' and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses."
BIO,"In the past, there were problems with all of these hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way."
BIO,"The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles."
BIO,"The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells."
BIO,"Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains."
BIO,"This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses."
BIO,"The evidence for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences give a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses."
BIO,"To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct."
BIO,"It seems unlikely that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms."
BIO,"Scientific opinions differ on whether viruses are a form of life or organic structures that interact with living organisms."
BIO,"They have been described as "organisms at the edge of life", since they resemble organisms in that they possess genes, evolve by natural selection, and reproduce by creating multiple copies of themselves through self-assembly."
BIO,"Although they have genes, they do not have a cellular structure, which is often seen as the basic unit of life."
BIO,"Viruses do not have their own metabolism and require a host cell to make new products."
BIO,"They therefore cannot naturally reproduce outside a host cell—although some bacteria such as rickettsia and chlamydia are considered living organisms despite the same limitation."
BIO,"Accepted forms of life use cell division to reproduce, whereas viruses spontaneously assemble within cells."
BIO,"They differ from autonomous growth of crystals as they inherit genetic mutations while being subject to natural selection."
BIO,"Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life, as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules."
BIO,"Viruses display a wide diversity of sizes and shapes, called 'morphologies'."
BIO,"In general, viruses are much smaller than bacteria and more than a thousand bacteriophage viruses would fit inside an Escherichia coli bacterium's cell."
BIO,"Many viruses that have been studied are spherical and have a diameter between 20 and 300 nanometres."
BIO,"Some filoviruses, which are filaments, have a total length of up to 1400 nm; their diameters are only about 80 nm."
BIO,"Most viruses cannot be seen with an optical microscope, so scanning and transmission electron microscopes are used to visualise them."
BIO,"To increase the contrast between viruses and the background, electron-dense "stains" are used."
BIO,"These are solutions of salts of heavy metals, such as tungsten, that scatter the electrons from regions covered with the stain."
BIO,"When virions are coated with stain (positive staining), fine detail is obscured."
BIO,"Negative staining overcomes this problem by staining the background only."
BIO,"A complete virus particle, known as a virion, consists of nucleic acid surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid."
BIO,"These are formed from protein subunits called capsomeres."
BIO,"Viruses can have a lipid "envelope" derived from the host cell membrane."
BIO,"The capsid is made from proteins encoded by the viral genome and its shape serves as the basis for morphological distinction."
BIO,"Virally-coded protein subunits will self-assemble to form a capsid, in general requiring the presence of the virus genome."
BIO,"Complex viruses code for proteins that assist in the construction of their capsid."
BIO,"Proteins associated with nucleic acid are known as nucleoproteins, and the association of viral capsid proteins with viral nucleic acid is called a nucleocapsid."
BIO,"The capsid and entire virus structure can be mechanically (physically) probed through atomic force microscopy."
BIO,"In general, there are five main morphological virus types."
BIO,"These viruses are composed of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube."
BIO,"This arrangement results in virions which can be short and highly rigid rods, or long and very flexible filaments."
BIO,"The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but single-stranded DNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein."
BIO,"Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres."
BIO,"The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus and inovirus are examples of helical viruses."
BIO,"Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral icosahedral symmetry."
BIO,"A regular icosahedron is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical subunits."
BIO,"The minimum number of capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron."
BIO,"Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry."
BIO,"To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons."
BIO,"Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called hexons."
BIO,"Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved."
BIO,"The same protein may act as the subunit of both the pentamers and hexamers or they may be composed of different proteins."
BIO,"This is an icosahedron elongated along the fivefold axis and is a common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages."
BIO,"This structure is composed of a cylinder with a cap at either end."
BIO,"Some species of virus envelop themselves in a modified form of one of the cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as a nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope."
BIO,"This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host."
BIO,"Influenza virus, HIV (which causes AIDS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (which causes COVID-19) use this strategy."
BIO,"Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity."
BIO,"These viruses possess a capsid that is neither purely helical nor purely icosahedral, and that may possess extra structures such as protein tails or a complex outer wall."
BIO,"Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres."
BIO,"This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell."
BIO,"The poxviruses are large, complex viruses that have an unusual morphology."
BIO,"The viral genome is associated with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid."
BIO,"The nucleoid is surrounded by a membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function."
BIO,"The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface."
BIO,"The whole virion is slightly pleomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick-shaped."
BIO,"Mimivirus is one of the largest characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400 nm."
BIO,"Protein filaments measuring 100 nm project from the surface."
BIO,"The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral."
BIO,"In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile."
BIO,"Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope."
BIO,"In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus."
BIO,"All giant viruses have dsDNA genomes and they are classified into several families: Mimiviridae, Pithoviridae, Pandoraviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and the Mollivirus genus."
BIO,"Some viruses that infect Archaea have complex structures unrelated to any other form of virus, with a wide variety of unusual shapes, ranging from spindle-shaped structures to viruses that resemble hooked rods, teardrops or even bottles."
BIO,"Other archaeal viruses resemble the tailed bacteriophages, and can have multiple tail structures."
BIO,"An enormous variety of genomic structures can be seen among viral species; as a group, they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants, animals, archaea, or bacteria."
BIO,"There are millions of different types of viruses, although fewer than 7,000 types have been described in detail."
BIO,"As of January 2021, the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 193,000 complete genome sequences, but there are doubtlessly many more to be discovered."
BIO,"A virus has either a DNA or an RNA genome and is called a DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively."
BIO,"The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes."
BIO,"Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes."
BIO,"Viral genomes are circular, as in the polyomaviruses, or linear, as in the adenoviruses."
BIO,"The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome."
BIO,"Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented."
BIO,"For RNA viruses, each segment often codes for only one protein and they are usually found together in one capsid."
BIO,"All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by brome mosaic virus and several other plant viruses."
BIO,"A viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds)."
BIO,"Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle."
BIO,"Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder."
BIO,"The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded."
BIO,"For most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, the single strands are said to be either positive-sense (called the 'plus-strand') or negative-sense (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral messenger RNA (mRNA)."
BIO,"Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately translated by the host cell."
BIO,"Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase before translation."
BIO,"DNA nomenclature for viruses with genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-sense viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand."
BIO,"Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are ambisense in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate."
BIO,"Examples include geminiviruses, which are ssDNA plant viruses and arenaviruses, which are ssRNA viruses of animals."
BIO,"Genome size varies greatly between species."
BIO,"The smallest—the ssDNA circoviruses, family Circoviridae—code for only two proteins and have a genome size of only two kilobases; the largest—the pandoraviruses—have genome sizes of around two megabases which code for about 2500 proteins."
BIO,"Virus genes rarely have introns and often are arranged in the genome so that they overlap."
BIO,"In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses because of a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit."
BIO,"Beyond this, errors when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive."
BIO,"To compensate, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes—the genome is split into smaller molecules—thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will incapacitate the entire genome."
BIO,"In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes because of the high fidelity of their replication enzymes."
BIO,"Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case."
BIO,"Viruses undergo genetic change by several mechanisms."
BIO,"These include a process called antigenic drift where individual bases in the DNA or RNA mutate to other bases."
BIO,"Most of these point mutations are "silent"—they do not change the protein that the gene encodes—but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs."
BIO,"Antigenic shift occurs when there is a major change in the genome of the virus."
BIO,"This can be a result of recombination or reassortment."
BIO,"When this happens with influenza viruses, pandemics might result."
BIO,"RNA viruses often exist as quasispecies or swarms of viruses of the same species but with slightly different genome nucleoside sequences."
BIO,"Such quasispecies are a prime target for natural selection."
BIO,"Segmented genomes confer evolutionary advantages; different strains of a virus with a segmented genome can shuffle and combine genes and produce progeny viruses (or offspring) that have unique characteristics."
BIO,"This is called reassortment or 'viral sex'."
BIO,"Genetic recombination is a process by which a strand of DNA (or RNA) is broken and then joined to the end of a different DNA (or RNA) molecule."
BIO,"This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been rampant in the species studied."
BIO,"Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses."
BIO,"Coronaviruses have a single-strand positive-sense RNA genome."
BIO,"Replication of the genome is catalyzed by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."
BIO,"The mechanism of recombination used by coronaviruses likely involves template switching by the polymerase during genome replication."
BIO,"This process appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage."
BIO,"Viral populations do not grow through cell division, because they are acellular."
BIO,"Instead, they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves, and they assemble in the cell."
BIO,"When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of copies of the original virus."
BIO,"Their life cycle differs greatly between species, but there are six basic stages in their life cycle:"
BIO,"Attachment is a specific binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface."
BIO,"This specificity determines the host range and type of host cell of a virus."
BIO,"For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes."
BIO,"This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule—a chemokine receptor—which is most commonly found on the surface of CD4+ T-Cells."
BIO,"This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication."
BIO,"Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that result in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter."
BIO,"Penetration or viral entry follows attachment: Virions enter the host cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis or membrane fusion."
BIO,"The infection of plant and fungal cells is different from that of animal cells."
BIO,"Plants have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose, and fungi one of chitin, so most viruses can get inside these cells only after trauma to the cell wall."
BIO,"Nearly all plant viruses (such as tobacco mosaic virus) can also move directly from cell to cell, in the form of single-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, through pores called plasmodesmata."
BIO,"Bacteria, like plants, have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell."
BIO,"Given that bacterial cell walls are much thinner than plant cell walls due to their much smaller size, some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their genome into the bacterial cell across the cell wall, while the viral capsid remains outside."
BIO,"Uncoating is a process in which the viral capsid is removed: This may be by degradation by viral enzymes or host enzymes or by simple dissociation; the end-result is the releasing of the viral genomic nucleic acid."
BIO,"Replication of viruses involves primarily multiplication of the genome."
BIO,"Replication involves the synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA) from "early" genes (with exceptions for positive-sense RNA viruses), viral protein synthesis, possible assembly of viral proteins, then viral genome replication mediated by early or regulatory protein expression."
BIO,"This may be followed, for complex viruses with larger genomes, by one or more further rounds of mRNA synthesis: "late" gene expression is, in general, of structural or virion proteins."
BIO,"Assembly – Following the structure-mediated self-assembly of the virus particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs."
BIO,"In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell."
BIO,"Release – Viruses can be released from the host cell by lysis, a process that kills the cell by bursting its membrane and cell wall if present: this is a feature of many bacterial and some animal viruses."
BIO,"Some viruses undergo a lysogenic cycle where the viral genome is incorporated by genetic recombination into a specific place in the host's chromosome."
BIO,"The viral genome is then known as a "provirus" or, in the case of bacteriophages a "prophage"."
BIO,"Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated."
BIO,"The viral genome is mostly silent within the host."
BIO,"At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to the active virus, which may lyse the host cells."
BIO,"Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by budding."
BIO,"During this process, the virus acquires its envelope, which is a modified piece of the host's plasma or other, internal membrane."
BIO,"Examples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores."
BIO,"Many serious diseases such as rabies, Ebola virus disease, AIDS (HIV), avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses."
BIO,"The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is described in terms of virulence."
BIO,"Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome."
BIO,"There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans."
BIO,"Viruses have different mechanisms by which they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species."
BIO,"Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell."
BIO,"In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects."
BIO,"Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism."
BIO,"An example would include the ability of the herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body."
BIO,"This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles."
BIO,"Most people have been infected with at least one of these types of herpes virus."
BIO,"These latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis."
BIO,"Some viruses can cause lifelong or chronic infections, where the viruses continue to replicate in the body despite the host's defence mechanisms."
BIO,"This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections."
BIO,"People chronically infected are known as carriers, as they serve as reservoirs of infectious virus."
BIO,"In populations with a high proportion of carriers, the disease is said to be endemic."
BIO,"Viral epidemiology is the branch of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans."
BIO,"Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person."
BIO,"Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus."
BIO,"Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in children and adults, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby."
BIO,"Horizontal transmission is the most common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations."
BIO,"Horizontal transmission can occur when body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, by exchange of saliva or when contaminated food or water is ingested."
BIO,"It can also occur when aerosols containing viruses are inhaled or by insect vectors such as when infected mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host."
BIO,"Most types of viruses are restricted to just one or two of these mechanisms and they are referred to as "respiratory viruses" or "enteric viruses" and so forth."
BIO,"The rate or speed of transmission of viral infections depends on factors that include population density, the number of susceptible individuals, (i.e., those not immune), the quality of healthcare and the weather."
BIO,"Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases."
BIO,"Control measures are used that are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted."
BIO,"It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus."
BIO,"Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines."
BIO,"When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective."
BIO,"Often, infected people are isolated from the rest of the community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine."
BIO,"To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered."
BIO,"Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms."
BIO,"Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections."
BIO,"Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability—a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal."
BIO,"This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks."
BIO,"When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics."
BIO,"If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics."
BIO,"Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in aquatic environments."
BIO,"There are about ten million of them in a teaspoon of seawater."
BIO,"Most of these viruses are bacteriophages infecting heterotrophic bacteria and cyanophages infecting cyanobacteria and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems."
BIO,"Bacteriophages are harmless to plants and animals, and are essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems are important mortality agents of phytoplankton, the base of the foodchain in aquatic environments."
BIO,"They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and are one of the most important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments."
BIO,"The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth, in a process known as the viral shunt."
BIO,"In particular, lysis of bacteria by viruses has been shown to enhance nitrogen cycling and stimulate phytoplankton growth."
BIO,"Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean."
BIO,"Microorganisms constitute more than 90% of the biomass in the sea."
BIO,"It is estimated that viruses kill approximately 20% of this biomass each day and that there are 10 to 15 times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea."
BIO,"Viruses are also major agents responsible for the destruction of phytoplankton including harmful algal blooms, The number of viruses in the oceans decreases further offshore and deeper into the water, where there are fewer host organisms."
BIO,"In January 2018, scientists reported that 800 million viruses, mainly of marine origin, are deposited daily from the Earth's atmosphere onto every square meter of the planet's surface, as the result of a global atmospheric stream of viruses, circulating above the weather system but below the altitude of usual airline travel, distributing viruses around the planet."
BIO,"Like any organism, marine mammals are susceptible to viral infections."
BIO,"In 1988 and 2002, thousands of harbour seals were killed in Europe by phocine distemper virus."
BIO,"Many other viruses, including caliciviruses, herpesviruses, adenoviruses and parvoviruses, circulate in marine mammal populations."
BIO,"In December 2022, scientists reported the first observation of virovory via an experiment on pond water containing chlorovirus, which commonly infects green algae in freshwater environments."
BIO,"When all other microbial food sources were removed from the water, the ciliate Halteria was observed to have increased in number due to the active consumption of chlorovirus as a food source instead of its typical bacterivore diet."
COMP,"A computer virus is a type of malware that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code into those programs."
COMP,"If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus, a metaphor derived from biological viruses."
COMP,"Computer viruses generally require a host program."
COMP,"The virus writes its own code into the host program."
COMP,"When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage."
COMP,"By contrast, a computer worm does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk."
COMP,"Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks."
COMP,"Virus writers use social engineering deceptions and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to initially infect systems and to spread the virus."
COMP,"Viruses use complex anti-detection/stealth strategies to evade antivirus software."
COMP,"Motives for creating viruses can include seeking profit (e.g., with ransomware), desire to send a political message, personal amusement, to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software, for sabotage and denial of service, or simply because they wish to explore cybersecurity issues, artificial life and evolutionary algorithms."
COMP,"As of 2013, computer viruses caused billions of dollars' worth of economic damage each year."
COMP,"In response, an industry of antivirus software has cropped up, selling or freely distributing virus protection to users of various operating systems."
COMP,"The first academic work on the theory of self-replicating computer programs was done in 1949 by John von Neumann who gave lectures at the University of Illinois about the "Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata"."
COMP,"The work of von Neumann was later published as the "Theory of self-reproducing automata"."
COMP,"In his essay von Neumann described how a computer program could be designed to reproduce itself."
COMP,"Von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical "father" of computer virology."
COMP,"In 1972, Veith Risak directly building on von Neumann's work on self-replication, published his article "Selbstreproduzierende Automaten mit minimaler Informationsübertragung""
COMP,"(Self-reproducing automata with minimal information exchange)."
COMP,"The article describes a fully functional virus written in assembler programming language for a SIEMENS 4004/35 computer system."
COMP,"In 1980, Jürgen Kraus wrote his Diplom thesis "Selbstreproduktion bei Programmen""
COMP,"(Self-reproduction of programs)"
COMP,"at the University of Dortmund."
COMP,"In his work Kraus postulated that computer programs can behave in a way similar to biological viruses."
COMP,"The Creeper virus was first detected on ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet, in the early 1970s."
COMP,"Creeper was an experimental self-replicating program written by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies in 1971."
COMP,"Creeper used the ARPANET to infect DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system."
COMP,"Creeper gained access via the ARPANET and copied itself to the remote system where the message, "I'M THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!" was displayed."
COMP,"The Reaper program was created to delete Creeper."
COMP,"In 1982, a program called "Elk Cloner" was the first personal computer virus to appear "in the wild"—that is, outside the single computer or computer lab where it was created."
COMP,"Written in 1981 by Richard Skrenta, a ninth grader at Mount Lebanon High School near Pittsburgh, it attached itself to the Apple DOS 3.3 operating system and spread via floppy disk."
COMP,"On its 50th use the Elk Cloner virus would be activated, infecting the personal computer and displaying a short poem beginning "Elk Cloner: The program with a personality.""
COMP,"In 1984, Fred Cohen from the University of Southern California wrote his paper "Computer Viruses – Theory and Experiments"."
COMP,"It was the first paper to explicitly call a self-reproducing program a "virus", a term introduced by Cohen's mentor Leonard Adleman."
COMP,"In 1987, Fred Cohen published a demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses."
COMP,"Fred Cohen's theoretical compression virus was an example of a virus which was not malicious software"
COMP,"(malware), but was putatively benevolent"
COMP,"(well-intentioned)."
COMP,"However, antivirus professionals do not accept the concept of "benevolent viruses", as any desired function can be implemented without involving a virus"
COMP,"(automatic compression, for instance, is available under Windows at the choice of the user)."
COMP,"Any virus will by definition make unauthorised changes to a computer, which is undesirable even if no damage is done or intended."
COMP,"The first page of Dr Solomon's Virus Encyclopaedia explains the undesirability of viruses, even those that do nothing but reproduce."
COMP,"An article that describes "useful virus functionalities" was published by J. B. Gunn under the title "Use of virus functions to provide a virtual APL interpreter under user control" in 1984."
COMP,"The first IBM PC compatible virus in the "wild" was a boot sector virus dubbed"
COMP,"(c)Brain, created in 1986 and was released in 1987 by Amjad Farooq Alvi and Basit Farooq Alvi in Lahore, Pakistan, reportedly to deter unauthorized copying of the software they had written."
COMP,"The first virus to specifically target Microsoft Windows, WinVir was discovered in April 1992, two years after the release of Windows 3.0."
COMP,"The virus did not contain any Windows API calls, instead relying on DOS interrupts."
COMP,"A few years later, in February 1996, Australian hackers from the virus-writing crew VLAD created the Bizatch virus"
COMP,"(also known as "Boza" virus), which was the first known virus to target Windows 95."
COMP,"In late 1997 the encrypted, memory-resident stealth virus Win32.Cabanas was released—the first known virus that targeted Windows NT"
COMP,"(it was also able to infect Windows 3.0 and Windows 9x hosts)."
COMP,"Even home computers were affected by viruses."
COMP,"The first one to appear on the Amiga was a boot sector virus called SCA virus, which was detected in November 1987."
COMP,"A computer virus generally contains three parts: the infection mechanism, which finds and infects new files, the payload, which is the malicious code to execute, and the trigger, which determines when to activate the payload."
COMP,"Also called the infection vector, this is how the virus spreads."
COMP,"Some viruses have a search routine, which locate and infect files on disk."
COMP,"Other viruses infect files as they are run, such as the Jerusalem DOS virus."
COMP,"Also known as a logic bomb, this is the part of the virus that determines the condition for which the payload is activated."
COMP,"This condition may be a particular date, time, presence of another program, size on disk exceeding a threshold, or opening a specific file."
COMP,"The payload is the body of the virus that executes the malicious activity."
COMP,"Examples of malicious activities include damaging files, theft of confidential information or spying on the infected system."
COMP,"Payload activity is sometimes noticeable as it can cause the system to slow down or "freeze"."
COMP,"Sometimes payloads are non-destructive and their main purpose is to spread a message to as many people as possible."
COMP,"This is called a virus hoax."
COMP,"Virus phases is the life cycle of the computer virus, described by using an analogy to biology."
COMP,"This life cycle can be divided into four phases:"
COMP,"In the Dormant phase the virus program is idle during this stage."
COMP,"The virus program has managed to access the target user's computer or software, but during this stage, the virus does not take any action."
COMP,"The virus will eventually be activated by the "trigger" which states which event will execute the virus."
COMP,"Not all viruses have this stage."
COMP,"in the Propagation phase the virus starts propagating, which is multiplying and replicating itself."
COMP,"The virus places a copy of itself into other programs or into certain system areas on the disk."
COMP,"The copy may not be identical to the propagating version; viruses often "morph" or change to evade detection by IT professionals and anti-virus software."
COMP,"Each infected program will now contain a clone of the virus, which will itself enter a propagation phase."
COMP,"In the Triggering phase a dormant virus moves into this phase when it is activated, and will now perform the function for which it was intended."
COMP,"The triggering phase can be caused by a variety of system events, including a count of the number of times that this copy of the virus has made copies of itself."
COMP,"The trigger may occur when an employee is terminated from their employment or after a set period of time has elapsed, in order to reduce suspicion."
COMP,"In the Execution phase the actual work of the virus is done, where the "payload" will be released."
COMP,"It can be destructive such as deleting files on disk, crashing the system, or corrupting files or relatively harmless such as popping up humorous or political messages on screen."
COMP,"Computer viruses infect a variety of different subsystems on their host computers and software."
COMP,"One manner of classifying viruses is to analyze whether they reside in binary executables"
COMP,"(such as .EXE or .COM files), data files"
COMP,"(such as Microsoft Word documents or PDF files), or in the boot sector of the host's hard drive"
COMP,"(or some combination of all of these)."
COMP,"A memory-resident virus"
COMP,"(or simply "resident virus")"
COMP,"installs itself as part of the operating system when executed, after which it remains in RAM from the time the computer is booted up to when it is shut down."
COMP,"Resident viruses overwrite interrupt handling code or other functions, and when the operating system attempts to access the target file or disk sector, the virus code intercepts the request and redirects the control flow to the replication module, infecting the target."
COMP,"In contrast, a non-memory-resident virus"
COMP,"(or "non-resident virus"), when executed, scans the disk for targets, infects them, and then exits"
COMP,"(i.e. it does not remain in memory after it is done executing)."
COMP,"Many common applications, such as Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Word, allow macro programs to be embedded in documents or emails, so that the programs may be run automatically when the document is opened."
COMP,"A macro virus"
COMP,"(or "document virus")"
COMP,"is a virus that is written in a macro language and embedded into these documents so that when users open the file, the virus code is executed, and can infect the user's computer."
COMP,"This is one of the reasons that it is dangerous to open unexpected or suspicious attachments in e-mails."
COMP,"While not opening attachments in e-mails from unknown persons or organizations can help to reduce the likelihood of contracting a virus, in some cases, the virus is designed so that the e-mail appears to be from a reputable organization"
COMP,"(e.g., a major bank or credit card company)."
COMP,"Boot sector viruses specifically target the boot sector and/or the Master Boot Record"
COMP,"(MBR)"
COMP,"of the host's hard disk drive, solid-state drive, or removable storage media"
COMP,"(flash drives, floppy disks, etc.)."
COMP,"The most common way of transmission of computer viruses in boot sector is physical media."
COMP,"When reading the VBR of the drive, the infected floppy disk or USB flash drive connected to the computer will transfer data, and then modify or replace the existing boot code."
COMP,"The next time a user tries to start the desktop, the virus will immediately load and run as part of the master boot record."
COMP,"Email viruses are viruses that intentionally, rather than accidentally, use the email system to spread."
COMP,"While virus infected files may be accidentally sent as email attachments, email viruses are aware of email system functions."
COMP,"They generally target a specific type of email system"
COMP,"(Microsoft Outlook is the most commonly used), harvest email addresses from various sources, and may append copies of themselves to all email sent, or may generate email messages containing copies of themselves as attachments."
COMP,"To avoid detection by users, some viruses employ different kinds of deception."
COMP,"Some old viruses, especially on the DOS platform, make sure that the "last modified" date of a host file stays the same when the file is infected by the virus."
COMP,"This approach does not fool antivirus software, however, especially those which maintain and date cyclic redundancy checks on file changes."
COMP,"Some viruses can infect files without increasing their sizes or damaging the files."
COMP,"They accomplish this by overwriting unused areas of executable files."
COMP,"These are called cavity viruses."
COMP,"For example, the CIH virus, or Chernobyl Virus, infects Portable Executable files."
COMP,"Because those files have many empty gaps, the virus, which was 1 KB in length, did not add to the size of the file."
COMP,"Some viruses try to avoid detection by killing the tasks associated with antivirus software before it can detect them"
COMP,"(for example, Conficker)."
COMP,"A Virus may also hide its presence using a rootkit by not showing itself on the list of system processes or by disguising itself within a trusted process."
COMP,"In the 2010s, as computers and operating systems grow larger and more complex, old hiding techniques need to be updated or replaced."
COMP,"Defending a computer against viruses may demand that a file system migrate towards detailed and explicit permission for every kind of file access."
COMP,"In addition, only a small fraction of known viruses actually cause real incidents, primarily because many viruses remain below the theoretical epidemic threshold."
COMP,"While some kinds of antivirus software employ various techniques to counter stealth mechanisms, once the infection occurs any recourse to "clean" the system is unreliable."
COMP,"In Microsoft Windows operating systems, the NTFS file system is proprietary."
COMP,"This leaves antivirus software little alternative but to send a "read" request to Windows files that handle such requests."
COMP,"Some viruses trick antivirus software by intercepting its requests to the operating system."
COMP,"A virus can hide by intercepting the request to read the infected file, handling the request itself, and returning an uninfected version of the file to the antivirus software."
COMP,"The interception can occur by code injection of the actual operating system files that would handle the read request."
COMP,"Thus, an antivirus software attempting to detect the virus will either not be permitted to read the infected file, or, the "read" request will be served with the uninfected version of the same file."
COMP,"The only reliable method to avoid "stealth" viruses is to boot from a medium that is known to be "clear"."
COMP,"Security software can then be used to check the dormant operating system files."
COMP,"Most security software relies on virus signatures, or they employ heuristics."
COMP,"Security software may also use a database of file "hashes" for Windows OS files, so the security software can identify altered files, and request Windows installation media to replace them with authentic versions."
COMP,"In older versions of Windows, file cryptographic hash functions of Windows OS files stored in Windows—to allow file integrity/authenticity to be checked—could be overwritten so that the System File Checker would report that altered system files are authentic, so using file hashes to scan for altered files would not always guarantee finding an infection."
COMP,"Most modern antivirus programs try to find virus-patterns inside ordinary programs by scanning them for so-called virus signatures."
COMP,"Different antivirus programs will employ different search methods when identifying viruses."
COMP,"If a virus scanner finds such a pattern in a file, it will perform other checks to make sure that it has found the virus, and not merely a coincidental sequence in an innocent file, before it notifies the user that the file is infected."
COMP,"The user can then delete, or"
COMP,"(in some cases)"
COMP,""clean" or "heal" the infected file."
COMP,"Some viruses employ techniques that make detection by means of signatures difficult but probably not impossible."
COMP,"These viruses modify their code on each infection."
COMP,"That is, each infected file contains a different variant of the virus."
COMP,"One method of evading signature detection is to use simple encryption to encipher (encode) the body of the virus, leaving only the encryption module and a static cryptographic key in cleartext which does not change from one infection to the next."
COMP,"In this case, the virus consists of a small decrypting module and an encrypted copy of the virus code."
COMP,"If the virus is encrypted with a different key for each infected file, the only part of the virus that remains constant is the decrypting module, which would (for example) be appended to the end."
COMP,"In this case, a virus scanner cannot directly detect the virus using signatures, but it can still detect the decrypting module, which still makes indirect detection of the virus possible."
COMP,"Since these would be symmetric keys, stored on the infected host, it is entirely possible to decrypt the final virus, but this is probably not required, since self-modifying code is such a rarity that finding some may be reason enough for virus scanners to at least "flag" the file as suspicious."
COMP,"An old but compact way will be the use of arithmetic operation like addition or subtraction and the use of logical conditions such as XORing, where each byte in a virus is with a constant so that the exclusive-or operation had only to be repeated for decryption."
COMP,"It is suspicious for a code to modify itself, so the code to do the encryption/decryption may be part of the signature in many virus definitions."
COMP,"A simpler older approach did not use a key, where the encryption consisted only of operations with no parameters, like incrementing and decrementing, bitwise rotation, arithmetic negation, and logical NOT."
COMP,"Some viruses, called polymorphic viruses, will employ a means of encryption inside an executable in which the virus is encrypted under certain events, such as the virus scanner being disabled for updates or the computer being rebooted."
COMP,"This is called cryptovirology."
COMP,"Polymorphic code was the first technique that posed a serious threat to virus scanners."
COMP,"Just like regular encrypted viruses, a polymorphic virus infects files with an encrypted copy of itself, which is decoded by a decryption module."
COMP,"In the case of polymorphic viruses, however, this decryption module is also modified on each infection."
COMP,"A well-written polymorphic virus therefore has no parts which remain identical between infections, making it very difficult to detect directly using "signatures"."
COMP,"Antivirus software can detect it by decrypting the viruses using an emulator, or by statistical pattern analysis of the encrypted virus body."
COMP,"To enable polymorphic code, the virus has to have a polymorphic engine (also called "mutating engine" or "mutation engine") somewhere in its encrypted body."
COMP,"See polymorphic code for technical detail on how such engines operate."
COMP,"Some viruses employ polymorphic code in a way that constrains the mutation rate of the virus significantly."
COMP,"For example, a virus can be programmed to mutate only slightly over time, or it can be programmed to refrain from mutating when it infects a file on a computer that already contains copies of the virus."
COMP,"The advantage of using such slow polymorphic code is that it makes it more difficult for antivirus professionals and investigators to obtain representative samples of the virus, because "bait" files that are infected in one run will typically contain identical or similar samples of the virus."
COMP,"This will make it more likely that the detection by the virus scanner will be unreliable, and that some instances of the virus may be able to avoid detection."
COMP,"To avoid being detected by emulation, some viruses rewrite themselves completely each time they are to infect new executables."
COMP,"Viruses that utilize this technique are said to be in metamorphic code."
COMP,"To enable metamorphism, a "metamorphic engine" is needed."
COMP,"A metamorphic virus is usually very large and complex."
COMP,"For example, W32/Simile consisted of over 14,000 lines of assembly language code, 90% of which is part of the metamorphic engine."
COMP,"Damage is due to causing system failure, corrupting data, wasting computer resources, increasing maintenance costs or stealing personal information."
COMP,"Even though no antivirus software can uncover all computer viruses (especially new ones), computer security researchers are actively searching for new ways to enable antivirus solutions to more effectively detect emerging viruses, before they become widely distributed."
COMP,"A power virus is a computer program that executes specific machine code to reach the maximum CPU power dissipation (thermal energy output for the central processing units)."
COMP,"Computer cooling apparatus are designed to dissipate power up to the thermal design power, rather than maximum power, and a power virus could cause the system to overheat if it does not have logic to stop the processor."
COMP,"This may cause permanent physical damage."
COMP,"Power viruses can be malicious, but are often suites of test software used for integration testing and thermal testing of computer components during the design phase of a product, or for product benchmarking."
COMP,"Stability test applications are similar programs which have the same effect as power viruses (high CPU usage) but stay under the user's control."
COMP,"They are used for testing CPUs, for example, when overclocking."
COMP,"Spinlock in a poorly written program may cause similar symptoms, if it lasts sufficiently long."
COMP,"Different micro-architectures typically require different machine code to hit their maximum power."
COMP,"Examples of such machine code do not appear to be distributed in CPU reference materials."
COMP,"As software is often designed with security features to prevent unauthorized use of system resources, many viruses must exploit and manipulate security bugs, which are security defects in a system or application software, to spread themselves and infect other computers."
COMP,"Software development strategies that produce large numbers of "bugs" will generally also produce potential exploitable "holes" or "entrances" for the virus."
COMP,"To replicate itself, a virus must be permitted to execute code and write to memory."
COMP,"For this reason, many viruses attach themselves to executable files that may be part of legitimate programs (see code injection)."
COMP,"If a user attempts to launch an infected program, the virus' code may be executed simultaneously."
COMP,"In operating systems that use file extensions to determine program associations (such as Microsoft Windows), the extensions may be hidden from the user by default."
COMP,"This makes it possible to create a file that is of a different type than it appears to the user."
COMP,"For example, an executable may be created and named "picture.png.exe", in which the user sees only "picture.png" and therefore assumes that this file is a digital image and most likely is safe, yet when opened, it runs the executable on the client machine."
COMP,"Viruses may be installed on removable media, such as flash drives."
COMP,"The drives may be left in a parking lot of a government building or other target, with the hopes that curious users will insert the drive into a computer."
COMP,"In a 2015 experiment, researchers at the University of Michigan found that 45–98 percent of users would plug in a flash drive of unknown origin."
COMP,"The vast majority of viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows."
COMP,"This is due to Microsoft's large market share of desktop computer users."
COMP,"The diversity of software systems on a network limits the destructive potential of viruses and malware."
COMP,"Open-source operating systems such as Linux allow users to choose from a variety of desktop environments, packaging tools, etc., which means that malicious code targeting any of these systems will only affect a subset of all users."
COMP,"Many Windows users are running the same set of applications, enabling viruses to rapidly spread among Microsoft Windows systems by targeting the same exploits on large numbers of hosts."
COMP,"While Linux and Unix in general have always natively prevented normal users from making changes to the operating system environment without permission, Windows users are generally not prevented from making these changes, meaning that viruses can easily gain control of the entire system on Windows hosts."
COMP,"This difference has continued partly due to the widespread use of administrator accounts in contemporary versions like Windows XP."
COMP,"In 1997, researchers created and released a virus for Linux—known as "Bliss"."
COMP,"Bliss, however, requires that the user run it explicitly, and it can only infect programs that the user has the access to modify."
COMP,"Unlike Windows users, most Unix users do not log in as an administrator, or "root user", except to install or configure software; as a result, even if a user ran the virus, it could not harm their operating system."
COMP,"The Bliss virus never became widespread, and remains chiefly a research curiosity."
COMP,"Its creator later posted the source code to Usenet, allowing researchers to see how it worked."
COMP,"Before computer networks became widespread, most viruses spread on removable media, particularly floppy disks."
COMP,"In the early days of the personal computer, many users regularly exchanged information and programs on floppies."
COMP,"Some viruses spread by infecting programs stored on these disks, while others installed themselves into the disk boot sector, ensuring that they would be run when the user booted the computer from the disk, usually inadvertently."
COMP,"Personal computers of the era would attempt to boot first from a floppy if one had been left in the drive."
COMP,"Until floppy disks fell out of use, this was the most successful infection strategy and boot sector viruses were the most common in the "wild" for many years."
COMP,"Traditional computer viruses emerged in the 1980s, driven by the spread of personal computers and the resultant increase in bulletin board system (BBS), modem use, and software sharing."
COMP,"Bulletin board–driven software sharing contributed directly to the spread of Trojan horse programs, and viruses were written to infect popularly traded software."
COMP,"Shareware and bootleg software were equally common vectors for viruses on BBSs."
COMP,"Viruses can increase their chances of spreading to other computers by infecting files on a network file system or a file system that is accessed by other computers."
COMP,"Macro viruses have become common since the mid-1990s."
COMP,"Most of these viruses are written in the scripting languages for Microsoft programs such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and spread throughout Microsoft Office by infecting documents and spreadsheets."
COMP,"Since Word and Excel were also available for Mac OS, most could also spread to Macintosh computers."
COMP,"Although most of these viruses did not have the ability to send infected email messages, those viruses which did take advantage of the Microsoft Outlook Component Object Model (COM) interface."
COMP,"Some old versions of Microsoft Word allow macros to replicate themselves with additional blank lines."
COMP,"If two macro viruses simultaneously infect a document, the combination of the two, if also self-replicating, can appear as a "mating" of the two and would likely be detected as a virus unique from the "parents"."
COMP,"A virus may also send a web address link as an instant message to all the contacts (e.g., friends and colleagues' e-mail addresses) stored on an infected machine."
COMP,"If the recipient, thinking the link is from a friend (a trusted source) follows the link to the website, the virus hosted at the site may be able to infect this new computer and continue propagating."
COMP,"Viruses that spread using cross-site scripting were first reported in 2002, and were academically demonstrated in 2005."
COMP,"There have been multiple instances of the cross-site scripting viruses in the "wild", exploiting websites such as MySpace (with the Samy worm) and Yahoo!."
COMP,"In 1989 The ADAPSO Software Industry Division published Dealing With Electronic Vandalism, in which they followed the risk of data loss by "the added risk of losing customer confidence.""
COMP,"Many users install antivirus software that can detect and eliminate known viruses when the computer attempts to download or run the executable file (which may be distributed as an email attachment, or on USB flash drives, for example)."
COMP,"Some antivirus software blocks known malicious websites that attempt to install malware."
COMP,"Antivirus software does not change the underlying capability of hosts to transmit viruses."
COMP,"Users must update their software regularly to patch security vulnerabilities ("holes")."
COMP,"Antivirus software also needs to be regularly updated to recognize the latest threats."
COMP,"This is because malicious hackers and other individuals are always creating new viruses."
COMP,"The German AV-TEST Institute publishes evaluations of antivirus software for Windows and Android."
COMP,"Examples of Microsoft Windows anti virus and anti-malware software include the optional Microsoft Security Essentials (for Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7) for real-time protection, the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (now included with Windows (Security) Updates on "Patch Tuesday", the second Tuesday of each month), and Windows Defender (an optional download in the case of Windows XP)."
COMP,"Additionally, several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet (usually restricted to non-commercial use)."
COMP,"Some such free programs are almost as good as commercial competitors."
COMP,"Common security vulnerabilities are assigned CVE IDs and listed in the US National Vulnerability Database."
COMP,"Secunia PSI is an example of software, free for personal use, that will check a PC for vulnerable out-of-date software, and attempt to update it."
COMP,"Ransomware and phishing scam alerts appear as press releases on the Internet Crime Complaint Center noticeboard."
COMP,"Ransomware is a virus that posts a message on the user's screen saying that the screen or system will remain locked or unusable until a ransom payment is made."
COMP,"Phishing is a deception in which the malicious individual pretends to be a friend, computer security expert, or other benevolent individual, with the goal of convincing the targeted individual to reveal passwords or other personal information."
COMP,"Other commonly used preventive measures include timely operating system updates, software updates, careful Internet browsing (avoiding shady websites), and installation of only trusted software."
COMP,"Certain browsers flag sites that have been reported to Google and that have been confirmed as hosting malware by Google."
COMP,"There are two common methods that an antivirus software application uses to detect viruses, as described in the antivirus software article."
COMP,"The first, and by far the most common method of virus detection is using a list of virus signature definitions."
COMP,"This works by examining the content of the computer's memory (its Random Access Memory (RAM), and boot sectors) and the files stored on fixed or removable drives (hard drives, floppy drives, or USB flash drives), and comparing those files against a database of known virus "signatures"."
COMP,"Virus signatures are just strings of code that are used to identify individual viruses; for each virus, the antivirus designer tries to choose a unique signature string that will not be found in a legitimate program."
COMP,"Different antivirus programs use different "signatures" to identify viruses."
COMP,"The disadvantage of this detection method is that users are only protected from viruses that are detected by signatures in their most recent virus definition update, and not protected from new viruses (see "zero-day attack")."
COMP,"A second method to find viruses is to use a heuristic algorithm based on common virus behaviors."
COMP,"This method can detect new viruses for which antivirus security firms have yet to define a "signature", but it also gives rise to more false positives than using signatures."
COMP,"False positives can be disruptive, especially in a commercial environment, because it may lead to a company instructing staff not to use the company computer system until IT services have checked the system for viruses."
COMP,"This can slow down productivity for regular workers."
COMP,"One may reduce the damage done by viruses by making regular backups of data (and the operating systems) on different media, that are either kept unconnected to the system (most of the time, as in a hard drive), read-only or not accessible for other reasons, such as using different file systems."
COMP,"This way, if data is lost through a virus, one can start again using the backup (which will hopefully be recent)."
COMP,"If a backup session on optical media like CD and DVD is closed, it becomes read-only and can no longer be affected by a virus (so long as a virus or infected file was not copied onto the CD/DVD)."
COMP,"Likewise, an operating system on a bootable CD can be used to start the computer if the installed operating systems become unusable."
COMP,"Backups on removable media must be carefully inspected before restoration."
COMP,"The Gammima virus, for example, propagates via removable flash drives."
COMP,"Many websites run by antivirus software companies provide free online virus scanning, with limited "cleaning" facilities (after all, the purpose of the websites is to sell antivirus products and services)."
COMP,"Some websites—like Google subsidiary VirusTotal.com—allow users to upload one or more suspicious files to be scanned and checked by one or more antivirus programs in one operation."
COMP,"Additionally, several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet (usually restricted to non-commercial use)."
COMP,"Microsoft offers an optional free antivirus utility called Microsoft Security Essentials, a Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool that is updated as part of the regular Windows update regime, and an older optional anti-malware (malware removal) tool Windows Defender that has been upgraded to an antivirus product in Windows 8."
COMP,"Some viruses disable System Restore and other important Windows tools such as Task Manager and CMD."
COMP,"An example of a virus that does this is CiaDoor."
COMP,"Many such viruses can be removed by rebooting the computer, entering Windows "safe mode" with networking, and then using system tools or Microsoft Safety Scanner."
COMP,"System Restore on Windows Me, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 can restore the registry and critical system files to a previous checkpoint."
COMP,"Often a virus will cause a system to "hang" or "freeze", and a subsequent hard reboot will render a system restore point from the same day corrupted."
COMP,"Restore points from previous days should work, provided the virus is not designed to corrupt the restore files and does not exist in previous restore points."
COMP,"Microsoft's System File Checker (improved in Windows 7 and later) can be used to check for, and repair, corrupted system files."
COMP,"Restoring an earlier "clean" (virus-free) copy of the entire partition from a cloned disk, a disk image, or a backup copy is one solution—restoring an earlier backup disk "image" is relatively simple to do, usually removes any malware, and may be faster than "disinfecting" the computer—or reinstalling and reconfiguring the operating system and programs from scratch, as described below, then restoring user preferences."
COMP,"Reinstalling the operating system is another approach to virus removal."
COMP,"It may be possible to recover copies of essential user data by booting from a live CD, or connecting the hard drive to another computer and booting from the second computer's operating system, taking great care not to infect that computer by executing any infected programs on the original drive."
COMP,"The original hard drive can then be reformatted and the OS and all programs installed from original media."
COMP,"Once the system has been restored, precautions must be taken to avoid reinfection from any restored executable files."
COMP,"The first known description of a self-reproducing program in fiction is in the 1970 short story The Scarred Man by Gregory Benford which describes a computer program called VIRUS which, when installed on a computer with telephone modem dialing capability, randomly dials phone numbers until it hits a modem that is answered by another computer, and then attempts to program the answering computer with its own program, so that the second computer will also begin dialing random numbers, in search of yet another computer to program."
COMP,"The program rapidly spreads exponentially through susceptible computers and can only be countered by a second program called VACCINE."
COMP,"His story was based on an actual computer virus written in FORTRAN that Benford had created and run on the lab computer in the 1960s, as a proof-of-concept, and which he told John Brunner about in 1970."
COMP,"The idea was explored further in two 1972 novels, When HARLIE Was One by David Gerrold and The Terminal Man by Michael Crichton, and became a major theme of the 1975 novel The Shockwave Rider by John Brunner."
COMP,"The 1973 Michael Crichton sci-fi film Westworld made an early mention of the concept of a computer virus, being a central plot theme that causes androids to run amok."
COMP,"Alan Oppenheimer's character summarizes the problem by stating that "...there's a clear pattern here which suggests an analogy to an infectious disease process, spreading from one...area to the next.""
COMP,"To which the replies are stated: "Perhaps there are superficial similarities to disease" and, "I must confess I find it difficult to believe in a disease of machinery.""
COMP,"The term "virus" is also misused by extension to refer to other types of malware."
COMP,""Malware" encompasses computer viruses along with many other forms of malicious software, such as computer "worms", ransomware, spyware, adware, trojan horses, keyloggers, rootkits, bootkits, malicious Browser Helper Object (BHOs), and other malicious software."
COMP,"The majority of active malware threats are trojan horse programs or computer worms rather than computer viruses."
COMP,"The term computer virus, coined by Fred Cohen in 1985, is a misnomer."
COMP,"Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected host computers, such as acquisition of hard disk space or central processing unit (CPU) time, accessing and stealing private information (e.g., credit card numbers, debit card numbers, phone numbers, names, email addresses, passwords, bank information, house addresses, etc.), corrupting data, displaying political, humorous or threatening messages on the user's screen, spamming their e-mail contacts, logging their keystrokes, or even rendering the computer useless."
COMP,"However, not all viruses carry a destructive "payload" and attempt to hide themselves—the defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs that modify other software without user consent by injecting themselves into the said programs, similar to a biological virus which replicates within living cells."
COMP,"The compilation of a unified list of computer viruses is made difficult because of naming."
COMP,"To aid the fight against computer viruses and other types of malicious software, many security advisory organizations and developers of anti-virus software compile and publish lists of viruses."
COMP,"When a new virus appears, the rush begins to identify and understand it as well as develop appropriate counter-measures to stop its propagation."
COMP,"Along the way, a name is attached to the virus."
COMP,"As the developers of anti-virus software compete partly based on how quickly they react to the new threat, they usually study and name the viruses independently."
COMP,"By the time the virus is identified, many names denote the same virus."
COMP,"Another source of ambiguity in names is that sometimes a virus initially identified as a completely new virus is found to be a variation of an earlier known virus, in which cases, it is often renamed."
COMP,"For example, the second variation of the Sobig worm was initially called "Palyh" but later renamed "Sobig.b"."
COMP,"Again, depending on how quickly this happens, the old name may persist."
COMP,"A computer virus is a program that spreads by first infecting files or the system areas of a computer or network router's hard drive and then making copies of itself."
COMP,"Some viruses are harmless, others may damage data files, and some may destroy files."
COMP,"Viruses used to be spread when people shared floppy disks and other portable media, now viruses are primarily spread through email messages."
COMP,"Unlike worms, viruses often require some sort of user action (e.g., opening an email attachment or visiting a malicious web page) to spread."
COMP,"A virus is simply a computer program--it can do anything that any other program you run on your computer can do."
COMP,"Some viruses are designed to deliberately damage files, and others may just spread to other computers."
COMP,"A worm is a type of virus that can spread without human interaction."
COMP,"Worms often spread from computer to computer and take up valuable memory and network bandwidth, which can cause a computer to stop responding."
COMP,"Worms can also allow attackers to gain access to your computer remotely."
COMP,"A Trojan horse is a computer program that is hiding a virus or other potentially damaging program."
COMP,"A Trojan horse can be a program that purports to do one action when, in fact, it is performing a malicious action on your computer."
COMP,"Trojan horses can be included in software that you download for free or as attachments in email messages."
COMP,"Most viruses, Trojan horses, and worms are activated when you open an attachment or click a link contained in an email message."
COMP,"If your email client allows scripting, then it is possible to get a virus by simply opening a message."
COMP,"It's best to limit what HTML is available in your email messages."
COMP,"The safest way to view email messages is in plain text."
COMP,"Most users get viruses from opening and running unknown email attachments."
COMP,"Never open anything that is attached to an email message unless you know the contents of the file."
COMP,"If you receive an attachment from a familiar email address, but were not expecting anything, you should contact the sender before opening the attachment."
COMP,"If you receive a message with an attachment and you do not recognize the sender, you should delete the message."
COMP,"Selecting the option to view your email messages in plain text, not HTML, will also help you to avoid a virus."
COMP,"Install anti-virus software from a reputable vendor."
COMP,"Update it and use it regularly."
COMP,"In addition to scanning for viruses on a regular basis, install an "on access" scanner (included in most anti-virus software packages) and configure it to start each time you start up your computer."
COMP,"This will protect your system by checking for viruses each time you run an executable file."
COMP,"Use a virus scan before you open any new programs or files that may contain executable code."
COMP,"This includes packaged software that you buy from the store as well as any program you might download from the Internet."
COMP,"If you are a member of an online community or chat room, be very careful about accepting files or clicking links that you find or that people send you within the community."
COMP,"Make sure you back up your data (documents, bookmark files, important email messages, etc.) on disc so that in the event of a virus infection, you do not lose valuable work."
COMP,"A computer virus is a type of malware that attaches to another program (like a document), which can replicate and spread after a person first runs it on their system."
COMP,"For instance, you could receive an email with a malicious attachment, open the file unknowingly, and then the computer virus runs on your computer."
COMP,"Viruses are harmful and can destroy data, slow down system resources, and log keystrokes."
COMP,"Cybercriminals aren’t creating new viruses all the time, instead they focus their efforts on more sophisticated and lucrative threats."
COMP,"When people talk about “getting a virus” on their computer, they usually mean some form of malware—it could be a virus, computer worm, Trojan, ransomware or some other harmful thing."
COMP,"Viruses and malware continue to evolve, and often cybercriminals use the type that gives them the best return at that particular time."
COMP,"The terms “virus” and “malware” are often used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing."
COMP,"While a computer virus is a type of malware, not all malware are computer viruses."
COMP,"A computer virus works in much the same way:"
COMP,"A computer virus requires a host program."
COMP,"A computer virus requires user action to transmit from one system to another."
COMP,"A computer virus attaches bits of its own malicious code to other files or replaces files outright with copies of itself"
COMP,"It’s that second virus trait that tends to confuse people."
COMP,"Viruses can’t spread without some sort of action from a user, like opening up an infected Word document."
COMP,"Worms, on the other hand, are able to spread across systems and networks on their own, making them much more prevalent and dangerous."
COMP,"Famously, the 2017 WannaCry ransomware worm spread around the world, took down thousands of Windows systems, and raked in an appreciable amount of untraceable Bitcoin ransom payments for the alleged North Korean attackers."
COMP,"Computer viruses don’t typically capture headlines like that—at least not anymore."
COMP,"They are still a harmful type of malware, but they are not the only type of threat out there today, on your computer or mobile device."
COMP,"Many computer viruses target systems running Microsoft Windows."
COMP,"Macs, on the other hand, have enjoyed a reputation as virus-proof super machines, but in Apple’s own admission, Macs do get malware."
COMP,"There are more Windows users in the world than Mac users and cybercriminals simply choose to write viruses for the operating system (OS) with the largest amount of potential victims."
COMP,"Today, the “computer” in our pockets may be the one we use most often: our smartphones."
COMP,"Android and iOS are susceptible to various forms of malware, too."
COMP,"Fortunately, most cybersecurity companies like Malwarebytes offer protection for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS today."
COMP,"Preventing computer viruses from infecting your computer starts with situational awareness."
COMP,"“Situational awareness is something law enforcement and militaries have practiced for decades. It refers to a police officer or a soldier’s ability to perceive threats and make the best decision possible in a potentially stressful situation,” said Malwarebytes Head of Security, John Donovan."
COMP,"“As it applies to cybersecurity, situational awareness is your first line of defense against cyberthreats. By staying on the lookout for phishing attacks and avoiding suspicious links and attachments, consumers can largely avoid most malware threats.”"
COMP,"Regarding email attachments and embedded links, even if the sender is someone you know: viruses have been known to hijack Outlook contact lists on infected computers and send virus laden attachments to friends, family and coworkers, the Melissa virus being a perfect example."

COMP,"We’ve made a distinction between computer viruses and malware, which now begs the question, “Do I need antivirus software or anti-malware software?”"
COMP,"We’ve covered this topic before in great detail so checkout our article on antivirus vs. anti-malware."
COMP,"For now, though, here’s a quick gloss on the subject."
COMP,"Antivirus (AV) refers to early forms of cybersecurity software focused on stopping computer viruses."
COMP,"Just viruses."
COMP,"Anti-malware refers to all-encompassing threat protection designed to stop old-fashioned viruses as well as today’s malware threats."
COMP,"Given a choice between traditional AV with limited threat detection technology and modern anti-malware with all the bells and whistles, invest in anti-malware and rest easy at night."
COMP,"As mentioned previously in this piece, traditional AV solutions rely on signature-based detection."
COMP,"AV scans your computer and compares each and every file against a database of known viruses that functions a lot like a criminal database."
COMP,"If there’s a signature match, the malicious file is thrown into virus jail before it can cause any damage."
COMP,"The problem with signature-based detection is that it can’t stop what’s known as a zero-day virus; that is, a virus that cybersecurity researchers have never seen before and for which there is no criminal profile."
COMP,"Until the zero-day virus is added to the database, traditional AV can’t detect it."
COMP,"Malwarebytes’ Multi-Vector Protection, conversely, combines several forms of threat detection technology into one malware crushing machine."
COMP,"Amongst these many layers of protection, Malwarebytes uses what’s called heuristic analysis to look for telltale malicious behavior from any given program."
COMP,"If it looks like a virus and behaves like a virus, then it’s probably a virus."

NON,"Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape, and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations."
NON,"Originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals", it has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus."
NON,"The former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while the latter concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves."
NON,"These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit."
NON,"Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz."
