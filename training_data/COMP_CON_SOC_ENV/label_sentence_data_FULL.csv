COMP_CON,"input from the Committee’s independent compensation consultant (FW Cook), taking into consideration relevant market data (when applicable), pay equity among the relevant employee group and other factors."
COMP_CON,"In consultation with FW Cook, we made these changes because we believe them to be important for employee retention and equitable to employees who have shown significant loyalty and service to us, and also because they encourage smooth leadership succession where an employee nearing retirement would otherwise forfeit on retirement a substantial unvested portion of his or her equity granted in the years immediately preceding retirement."

COMP_CON,"Because the future performance of neither the Company nor the companies in our peer group are known at the time that the compensation opportunities under the Company’s programs are established, Pay Governance also performs for the Compensation Committee an annual review of the most recent historical alignment of pay and performance relative to the Company’s peers."

COMP_CON,"To support the Compensation Committee, Pay Governance performs extensive analyses focusing on executive compensation trends, compensation opportunity, total realizable pay, the difficulty of achieving incentive plan goals and pay-for-performance alignment."
COMP_CON,"However, with the assistance of Pay Governance, the Compensation Committee identifies a peer group of relevant public companies for which data are available that are comparable to the Company in at least some areas of our business."
COMP_CON,"During fiscal 2014, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with Pay Governance, removed SAIC, Inc. as one of the peer group companies as a result of its corporate reorganization and added Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation as a substitute comparable company."
COMP_CON,"The Compensation Committee and Pay Governance also reviewed, for reference, a report prepared by Towers Watson for management based on (1) the most recent available published survey data and (2) data from the peer companies’ most recent proxy filings on compensation levels of the highest-paid executives at comparably large companies."

Irrelevant,Fifty percent of the target award opportunity for each Named Executive Officer under the 2014 Cash Bonus Plan was based upon our achievement of CFVA relative to the CFVA delivered in 2013.

Irrelevant,"The assessment of individual performance takes into account a number of quantitative and qualitative factors such as attainment of key strategic goals and objectives, specific revenue and earnings goals for each business, successful acquisitions/divestitures and integration efforts, as well as the financial performance and overall company performance as described in the Executive Summary."
Irrelevant,"We did not achieve our threshold GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income goals, and therefore each named executive officer received no payout for 70% of his annual incentive that was allocated to financial goals."
Irrelevant,EBIT was selected as the appropriate performance measure since the level of EBIT reflects the operating strength and efficiency of the Company.
Irrelevant,"The EBIT incentive formula establishes the maximum amount payable each year under the MIP for each named executive officer; but the executives are not assured of earning this maximum amount, and it was not paid in prior years."
Irrelevant,"Set the foundation for the pre-launch and launch of new products through regulatory filings and key regulatory approvals, providing opportunity for future sales growth"
Irrelevant,Reward our executives for achievement of revenue
Irrelevant,The Committee established targets for GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income in February 2014.
Irrelevant,The following chart sets forth the GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income targets for 2014 and related achievement levels.
Irrelevant,"These targets were set in February 2014 and the revenue targets were then subject to minor self-executing adjustments (i.e., increases) to reflect our acquisition of Think Big Analytics in September 2014."
Irrelevant,"Our GAAP revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share goals used in the 2014 annual bonus program and the 2014 performance-based restricted share unit awards tie to our audited financial statements as adjusted and disclosed to investors in our quarterly earnings releases."
Irrelevant,"Delivered record-level germplasm yield advantage compared to competitor seed, supporting sales share, and implemented significant technology upgrades to advance breeding, testing and seed treatment efficiencies and collaboration"
Irrelevant,"During this period, the Company continued to focus on strengthening its financial position and executed strategies to create and deliver value to its shareholders and to position the Company for long-term success."
Irrelevant,"Mr. Moonves' leadership, the Company continued to return significant value to shareholders through a 25% increase in its dividend per share in 2014 and through its share repurchase program, and executed its plan to complete the divestiture of its Outdoor Americas business in 2014."
Irrelevant,Mr. Ianniello led his team to successfully manage the Company's finances.
Irrelevant,"Under Mr. Ianniello's leadership, the Company was successful in growing its earnings per share over the prior fiscal year and for the fifth consecutive fiscal year."
Irrelevant,"He focused on strengthening the Company's financial position and returning value to shareholders by successfully managing the Company's stock buyback program; restructuring the Company's debt portfolio to lower its weighted average interest rate; and amending the Company's credit facility to increase capacity and extend its maturity resulting in a full five-year term, giving the Company additional financial flexibility."
Irrelevant,"He also led improvements in the Company's operations and executed on the Company's strategic transformation objectives by expanding efforts to monetize the Company's premium content, including through the negotiations of key retransmission, station affiliation, streaming and VOD deals, increasing these revenue streams by 27% over the prior year."
Irrelevant,"Also, throughout 2014, Mr. Ianniello successfully communicated an effective message to the investment community; achieved significant tax savings from strategic tax planning and provided leadership and direction for the Company's information technology group."
Irrelevant,"Mr. Ambrosio effectively managed the Company's most significant areas of people and administrative costs, including controlling overall compensation and benefit expenses, reducing sourcing spend across the Company's business units (which will result in annualized savings in excess of $20 million) and negotiating key real estate occupancy costs (which resulted in more than $22 million in savings for 2014)."
Irrelevant,"The financial performance measure used to determine a significant portion of each executive’s earned award is adjusted EBITDA measured at the global level and, for each of our business units, also as measured at the business unit level."
Irrelevant,2014 Adjusted EBITDA Target under the EBP: The Committee uses adjusted EBITDA when establishing financial performance targets under the EBP so that we can effectively tie compensation to our operating results.2 We believe sustained growth in profitability over time significantly correlates to value creation for our stockholders.
Irrelevant,"For our CEO and other corporate executives who manage our global business, we measure adjusted EBITDA against plan at the global level."
Irrelevant,"For ourbusiness unit executives, we measure adjusted EBITDA against plan at both the business unit and the global level."
Irrelevant,"Target financial performance under the EBP corresponds to our Board-approved internal financial and operating plan established at the beginning of each performance year, which we believe represents appropriate goal-setting by us."
Irrelevant,"Following year-end, our actual financial performance is then compared to the targeted financial performance, and a resulting “adjustment factor” is applied to the executive’s entire target EBP award."
Irrelevant,"For our executives to be eligible to receive any award under the EBP in 2014, our actual financial performance had to exceed 70% of the applicable target for adjusted EBITDA (as indicated in the table above)."
Irrelevant,"Performance at the target level for adjusted EBITDA would have resulted in a 100% adjustment factor (i.e., no multiplier or discount applied to the EBP target award), and performance at 130% or greater of the target level for adjusted EBITDA would have resulted in a 200% adjustment factor (i.e.,a 2x multiplier applied to the entire target EBP award)."
Irrelevant,The adjustment factor for performance between 70% and 130% of the target level for adjusted EBITDA is linearly interpolated.
Irrelevant,"For example, in 2014 our adjusted EBITDA at the global level was 105.8% of target (resulting in a 119.3% adjustment factor to the portion of a target EBP award subject to global performance), adjusted EBITDA in our Americas business was 108.6% of target (for our CEO—Americas, resulting in a 128.7% adjustment factor to the 50% portion of his target EBP award subject to our Americas business performance), and adjusted EBITDA in our Asia Pacific business was 105.9% of target (for our Executive Chairman— Asia Pacific, resulting in a 119.7% adjustment factor to the 50% portion of his target EBP award subject to our Asia Pacific business performance)."
Irrelevant,"Once determined, the adjustment factor is applied to the entire target EBP award, and the portion of the resulting product subject to financial performance measures (as noted above, 80% of the 2014 EBP award for all named executive officers) becomes the “financial performance portion” of the total EBP award."

Irrelevant,"The Committee selected adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow as the financial measures on which to assess the company’s performance for purposes of funding the cash bonus pool."
Irrelevant,"These three financial metrics (adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow) were deemed appropriate by the Committee as they are of immediate interest to shareholders and are the primary measures as to which Baxter regularly provides guidance to the market."
Irrelevant,"Adjusted EPS is the most heavily weighted measure, as the Committee believes it is a straightforward measure of the company’s current ability to generate value that is well understood by shareholders."
Irrelevant,"The table also provides target and adjusted operating cash flow for 2014 and 2013, as 2013 was the first year such measure was used for the cash bonus pool."
Irrelevant,"The company calculated adjusted EPS for purposes of funding the cash bonus pool the same way it calculated adjusted EPS when it publicly announced its results — that is, the special items that were excluded from EPS to arrive at adjusted EPS were the same."
Irrelevant,"Baxter uses adjusted sales (rather than net sales) as a target for the same reason that Baxter provides sales guidance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations — that is, the company believes it provides a better perspective on underlying sales growth."
Irrelevant,"Based on the company’s performance against its 2014 financial targets, the bonus pool was funded at 1.92 times the base salary for each executive officer covered by the bonus pool (other than Mr. Parkinson, for whom the bonus pool was funded at 1.922 times his target cash bonus)."
Irrelevant,"As discussed above, Baxter performed relative to its adjusted EPS, adjusted sales and adjusted operating cash flow financial targets for 2014 at 101.2%, 102.2% and 97.8%, respectively."

Irrelevant,The 2014 bonuses for our executive officers were overwhelmingly based on whether the established financial performance objectives were met.
Irrelevant,The performance goals for the Incentive Plan are based on the financial plan approved by the Board at the beginning of the year.
Irrelevant,The measure of earnings was net operating earnings per share (after accounting for the cost of any incentive payout).
Irrelevant,"Net operating earnings was defined as income from continuing operations determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), adjusted for certain items, such as weather, gains and losses on the sale of assets, certain out-of-period items and reserve adjustments."
Irrelevant,"The cash flow measure, corporate funds from operations, was calculated by taking net income from operations and adding back non-cash items such as depreciation."

SOCENV_INC,Safety Performance—30% weighting
SOCENV_INC,"Total Recordable Incident Rate (""TRIR"")"
SOCENV_INC,"Total Potential Severity Rate (""TPSR"")"
SOCENV_INC,The safety performance targets for 2014 were approved by the Compensation Committee and levels are set annually to motivate our executives to achieve continuous improvement in safety performance and to meet strict internal standards.
SOCENV_INC,Safety performance targets are recommended to the Compensation Committee by the Board's Health Safety and Environment Committee.
SOCENV_INC,"The Compensation Committee measures our safety performance through a combination of components: Total Recordable Incident Rate (""TRIR""), Total Potential Severity Rate (""TPSR"") and Process Safety."
SOCENV_INC,Each component makes up one-third of the overall safety performance metric.
SOCENV_INC,"The following charts show our actual performance related to the formulaic payout amounts for TRIR, TPSR and Process Safety."
SOCENV_INC,"Together, the safety metric outcomes resulted in a formulaic payout percentage for this measure of 38% of the total target bonus opportunity for each of the Named Executive Officers in 2014."
SOCENV_INC,TRIR is a safety performance metric recognized by the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration and is used by companies across an array of different industries.
SOCENV_INC,"We calculate TRIR based upon the guidelines set forth by the International Association of Drilling Contractors (the ""IADC""), an industry group for the drilling industry."
SOCENV_INC,The IADC methodology calculates TRIR by taking the aggregate number of occurrences of work-related injuries or illnesses that result in any of the following: fatality; a physician or licensed health care professional recommending days away from work due to the injury or illness; an employee not being able to perform all of his or her routine job functions (but not resulting in days away from work); or any other medical care or treatment beyond minor first aid.
SOCENV_INC,"The TRIR is the number of such occurrences for every 200,000 employee hours worked."
SOCENV_INC,"The Compensation Committee approved a TRIR target for 2014 of .64, which would represent further progress toward our safety vision."
SOCENV_INC,Any TRIR outcome representing a shortfall of more than 20% as compared to the target would result in a 0% bonus payout for the TRIR metric and any outcome representing an improvement of 20% or greater as compared to the target would result in a payout of 200% for the TRIR metric.
SOCENV_INC,"Our TRIR outcome for 2014 was .54, representing an improvement of just under 20% as compared to target."
SOCENV_INC,This resulted in a formulaic result of 178% of target for the TRIR metric.
SOCENV_INC,TPSR is an internally developed safety measure that we utilize to capture the potential severity of incidents over a period of time.
SOCENV_INC,"TPSR is calculated by taking the sum of all potential severity values assigned to the incidents, multiplying that number by 200,000, then dividing that number by total employee hours worked."
SOCENV_INC,"After the occurrence of an incident, the manager(s) responsible for the drilling unit or onshore facility where the incident took place complete an incident report that assigns a preliminary severity value to the incident."
SOCENV_INC,The Company also has an independent oversight and review process to evaluate and confirm the potential severity assigned to each incident.
SOCENV_INC,The severity value is derived by inputting data into our comprehensive severity calculator.
SOCENV_INC,"For instance, for dropped objects, the height from which the item was dropped and the weight of the object are inputs into the severity calculator."
SOCENV_INC,"The Compensation Committee approved a TPSR target for 2014 of 25.80, which represents further progress toward our safety vision."
SOCENV_INC,Any TPSR outcome representing a shortfall of more than 20% as compared to the target would result in a 0% bonus payout for the TPSR metric and any outcome representing an improvement of 20% or greater as compared to the target would result in a payout of 200% for the TPSR metric.
SOCENV_INC,Our TPSR outcome for 2014 of 30.88 represented close to a 20% shortfall as compared to the target.
SOCENV_INC,This shortfall resulted in a formulaic result of 1.6% of target for the TPSR metric.
SOCENV_INC,"This TPSR measure, when considered in relation to TRIR offers a more holistic view of our safety performance."
SOCENV_INC,"During 2014, the company experienced a reduction in the number of recordable work related injuries or illnesses, leading to positive results reflected in TRIR; however, in reviewing our recordable safety incidents, we identified an increased prevalence of potential severity, leading to the weak TPSR result noted above."
SOCENV_INC,"Consistent with our commitment to safety, improving incident severity will be a point of focus for the Company in 2015."
SOCENV_INC,"We believe that in addition to personnel and behavioral safety, prevention and mitigation of major hazards or process incidents are critical components of a successful safety program."
SOCENV_INC,"Accordingly, Process Safety is an internally developed safety measure designed to assess the management of major hazards in order to prevent or mitigate a major accident or significant event."
SOCENV_INC,"To implement this safety measure, we measure the number of process safety events that are likely predictors or leading indicators of a potential significant event."
SOCENV_INC,"The 2014 target, for process safety events, was established equal to the baseline of events that occurred on our installations in 2013."
SOCENV_INC,"In 2014, the reduction in the number of process safety events resulted in maximum achievement of the Process Safety metric."
SOCENV_INC,"With the formulaic bonus outcome confirmed at 108%, the Compensation Committee then applied its discretion, taking into account views from the Health, Safety and Environmental Committee with respect to overall safety performance."
SOCENV_INC,people-related objectives such as retention and diversity;

SOCENV_INC,"Mr. Gatt Floridia’s 2014 objectives related to (a) new technology revenue and growth; operation team performance; and performance systems, each of which he achieved; (b) field costs and working capital, which he mostly achieved, and (c) non- productive time rate reduction and HSE, both of which he partly achieved."
SOCENV_INC,"Mr. Lynch’s award was structured so that 50 percent was based on achievement with respect to the adjusted Corporate Multiplier and 50 percent was based on performance of the regulated operations with respect to five specified performance measures: net income, safety, NOVs, customer satisfaction and service quality."
SOCENV_INC,"The HR Committee also established two extra credit goals for 2014, a 7.5 percent credit for zero fatalities and up to a 5 percent credit for cultural improvement."
SOCENV_INC,"The Company did not experience a fatal employee accident in 2014, which resulted in a 7.5 percent addition to the score."
SOCENV_INC,"In addition to reviewing each executive's contributions to the achievement of financial goals, for 2014, the Committee also considered the following key strategic objectives: (i) strengthening the Company's financial position; (ii) providing continuous flow of top-tier content; continuing to drive growth through strategic transformation of the Company; maintaining and building the Company's reputation as one of the most desirable organizations for top ""talent""; (v) continuing to ensure a high degree of focus on the importance of a diverse workforce; and (vi) positioning the Company for long-term success."
SOCENV_INC,"In lieu of the 25 percent weighting previously allocated to business transformation process, we increased our safety performance weighting to 15 percent from 5 percent and increased the weighting of each of our other three non-financial performance measures by 5 percent which increased each measure to 10 percent."
SOCENV_INC,"Ms. Miller — Continued to lead and improve our values and ethics program; provided leadership of our mergers and acquisitions function, overseeing an increase in our pipeline of potential opportunities; and provided oversight and advice for corporate governance matters and our stockholder engagement efforts."

SOCENV_INC,Safety (10 percent weight)
SOCENV_INC,"Zero Fatalities (7.5 percent extra credit), and"
SOCENV_INC,Culture (up to 5 percent extra credit).
SOCENV_INC,"The Company’s 2014 operating earnings per share, together with the Company’s performance on strategic measures and safety, produced an initial score of 172.7 percent of target."
SOCENV_INC,"Because the Company did not experience a fatal employee accident, 7.5 percent was added to the annual incentive award opportunity."
SOCENV_INC,"In addition, the HR Committee approved a 2.5 percent addition for the culture extra credit measure."
SOCENV_INC,"For AEP’s annual incentive compensation, the HR Committee balances meeting AEP’s operating earnings per share target with strategic, safety, zero fatality and corporate culture objectives."
SOCENV_INC,Safety (10%)
SOCENV_INC,"Recordable Case Rate (the number of Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable incidents per 200,000 work hours)"
SOCENV_INC,"Severity Rate (the number of lost and restricted duty days due to Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable incidents per 200,000 work hours)"
SOCENV_INC,"Contractor Recordable Case Rate (the number of Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable incidents per 200,000 work hours for major AEP contractors)"
SOCENV_INC,+7.5% for completing the year without a fatal work related employee incident
SOCENV_INC,"For 2014, operating earnings per share constituted 75 percent of the performance measure for annual incentive compensation and the remaining 25 percent of the performance measure for annual incentive compensation was tied to strategic and safety goals."
SOCENV_INC,"With safety as an AEP core value, maintaining the safety of AEP employees and the general public is always our primary consideration."
SOCENV_INC,"Accordingly, safety measures comprised 10 percent of the 2014 scorecard."
SOCENV_INC,We measure employee and contractor recordable case rate for both employees and contractors in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for recordable incidents.
SOCENV_INC,"We measure the incident severity rate by the number of lost and restricted duty work days per 200,000 work hours."
SOCENV_INC,"In addition to these safety measures, the HR Committee also established a fatality credit adjustment for 2014, which is discussed below."
SOCENV_INC,The HR Committee established a fatality adjustment credit for 2014 that would add 7.5 percent to the total score in the event of a fatality free year.
SOCENV_INC,"This earnings result, together with the Company’s performance on the measures discussed below (safety and strategic initiatives), produced a result of 172.7 percent of the target award opportunity for executive officers."
SOCENV_INC,"For 2014, the HR Committee developed a balanced scorecard to tie annual incentive awards to the Company’s safety and strategic objectives for the year."
SOCENV_INC,The Company’s objectives included motivating its employees and executing its human capital and diversity strategies.
SOCENV_INC,"The Company also invested in executive leadership development for women, which aims to identify and develop high potential women leaders within Accenture, and its annual program that focuses on building future client account leadership capabilities."
SOCENV_INC,"The Company was widely recognized externally as an employer of choice and for its diversity efforts to attract and retain working mothers, ethnic minorities, military veterans, people with disabilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) employees."
SOCENV_INC,"For the NEOs, 90% of the annual incentive opportunity was based on performance against financial metrics (operating profit, net sales, and cash flow, as described above) and 10% was based on performance against non-financial metrics (people safety, food safety and quality, and diversity and inclusion)."
SOCENV_INC,"Consequently, the incentive opportunities for Messrs. Kettering and Hamrock were subject to achievement with respect to the corporate financial measures (net operating earnings per share and corporate funds from operations), and achievement with respect to performance measures tied to the business unit net operating earnings (net of interest expense and income taxes) and business unit funds from operations and business unit safety measures for which they have responsibility."
SOCENV_INC,Interpolation for the safety goal only applies between trigger and target.

Irrelevant,"Based on these facts, the NEO’s target APP award is $250,000, and his total APP factor is 1.21, resulting in an APP award of $302,500."

Irrelevant,"Based upon Mr. Leverett’s significant contributions to the success of the Company, the Compensation Committee increased Mr. Leverett’s base salary approximately 3.2% over his 2013 base salary that became effective upon being named President of WEC in August 2013."
Irrelevant,"Based upon the level of business unit achievement and the level of corporate performance achievement each noted above, the 2014 bonus award, as a percentage of base salary, for each of Messrs. Holland, Beasley and Collins was equal to 99.3%, 104.7% and 109.8%, respectively."

Irrelevant,"Because the Company’s performance against the financial and operational goals resulted in significant STPP awards in 2014, the Compensation Committee determined that no further adjustments based upon individual contributions or otherwise were appropriate."
Irrelevant,"Because the Company’s policy is to maximize long- term stockholder value, as described fully in this CD&A, tax deductibility is not the only factor considered in setting compensation."

Irrelevant,"Compensation mix of base salary, short-term and long-term incentives provides compensation opportunities measured by a variety of time horizons to balance our near-term and long-term strategic goals."

Irrelevant,"For the performance year 2014, similar to 2013, actual earn-outs from performance shares were well below the targeted opportunity, reflecting sub-par three-year performance results."
Irrelevant,"For the same reasons, the Committee decided that the performance units would not include TSR as an additional goal, as it has done in previous years, because including a TSR goal likely would have also made the awards subject to the punitive excise tax."
Irrelevant,"For the second consecutive year, the Committee determined that, absent an increase in responsibilities, the base salary for each named executive officer would not be increased from the prior year level."
Irrelevant,"For the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2014, our total stockholder return was at the 52nd percentile of the peer group, resulting in the performance units vesting at a level of 102.4%."

Irrelevant,"For this award, performance was based entirely on the achievement of the Company’s cumulative EBITDA less CapEx target for the 2012-2014 period."

Irrelevant,"However, because in such cases the aircraft is being used for a business purpose, there is no incremental cost associated with the family travel, and no amounts are included for such travel."
Irrelevant,"However, because of Mr. Leverett’s role in the Company’s succession plan, we recommended, and the Compensation Committee approved, a higher target value."
Irrelevant,"However, because the strategic goals related to the Kemper IGCC were not fully executed in 2014, the Compensation Committee determined that the final payout for certain executive officers most accountable for high-level strategic decisions concerning the Kemper IGCC, including some of the named executive officers, should be reduced from the amount they would have otherwise received."
Irrelevant,"However, compensation that does not exceed $1 million during any fiscal year or that qualifies as “performance-based compensation” (as defined in Section 162(m)) is deductible."

Irrelevant,"However, in certain situations, the Committee may in its discretion approve compensation that will not meet these requirements in order to ensure competitive levels of total compensation for the NEOs or for other reasons."
Irrelevant,"However, in order to promote retention, the actual payment of these amounts are made in three equal installments in December 2014, December 2015 and December 2016, with each payment contingent on the NEO remaining employed with Applied on the date the payment is made, subject to certain prorata retirement-related acceleration of vesting for Mr. Splinter."

Irrelevant,"However, in some cases, we determine that it is appropriate to provide compensation that may exceed deductibility limits in order to meet market demands and retain key executives."
Irrelevant,"However, in the limited circumstances that the change in control results in none of the common stock of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent entity) being publicly traded following a change in control, then all such RSUs and stock options will vest in full, and all performance conditions for performance-based RSUs will be deemed satisfied at their target level, upon the change in control."

Irrelevant,"Our principles for ownership of stock, discussed on page 60, ensure that the executives and other employees have a vested interest in the long-term financial health, management, and success of the Company."
Irrelevant,"Our prior policy of granting RSUs in January and PSUs in March straddled two fiscal years, causing PSU grants to be reported in the proxy statement one year after RSU grants were reported."
Irrelevant,"Our professional laboratory services business announced and implemented six new relationships, and we continue to expand our pipeline of hospitals and integrated delivery networks interested in working with us to improve outcomes and reduce costs."
Irrelevant,Our program has been designed to provide a level of compensation that is strongly dependent upon the achievement of short-term and long-term goals that are aligned with the interests of our stockholders and customers.
Irrelevant,Our program is designed to align executive compensation with the Company’s performance.
Irrelevant,"Our program reflects a balanced mix of compensation awards to avoid excessive weight on any one performance measure and is designed to promote stability and growth (1) in the short-term through the payment of an annual incentive award with largely pre-set targets; and (2) in the long-term, through the payment of equity awards;"
Irrelevant,Our program reflects many best practices.
Irrelevant,"Our programs appropriately balance short- and long-term incentives, with nearly 50% of total target compensation for the NEOs provided in equity and focused on long-term performance."
Irrelevant,Our PSUs have a three-year performance period and are settled in stock.
Irrelevant,"Our relocation program requires an employee who receives relocation benefits to enter into a relocation agreement and provides that if the employee voluntarily terminates employment with the Company within 24 months of the effective date of relocation, the employee: (i) forfeits any remaining payments that may be due under the relocation program; and (ii) will be required to repay in full all relocation expenses paid to the employee or incurred by the Company on the employee’s behalf."

Irrelevant,"Our short-term and long-term compensation programs, including the compensation paid in fiscal 2014, are intended to qualify as deductible performance based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC)."
Irrelevant,Our STIP program for fiscal 2014 was based on two metrics and appropriately challenging goals set at the beginning of the performance period:
Irrelevant,"Our stock option, RSU, and PRSU grants contain a financial penalty (clawback) (which extends for a period beyond the exercise of options or the vesting of RSUs or PRSUs) for executives who violate our non-competition and/or non-solicitation rules or who violate other business standards established by Coach."
Irrelevant,"Our stock options and RSUs generally have five-year cliff vesting tied to continued employment with the Company, and management has sizable stock positions relative to their income, which together encourage focus on the long-term value of our stock, aligns management’s and stockholders’ interests and discourages excessive risk taking to optimize short-term and non-sustainable performance."
Irrelevant,"Our stock ownership guidelines require that senior management holds a significant amount of the Company’s common stock to further align their interests with stockholders over the long-term by having a portion of their personal investment portfolio consist of Company stock, and we expect this component to be a risk mitigator on a prospective basis."
Irrelevant,Our Stock Plan and Bonus Plan are intended to permit (but not require) the Committee to award compensation that is “performance-based” and thus fully tax-deductible by Applied.

Irrelevant,Peer Group and Competitive Assessment of Compensation
Irrelevant,Peer group data is not used as the determining factor in setting compensation for the following reasons: (a) the officer’s role and experience within the Company may be different from the role and experience of comparable officers at the peer companies; (b) the average actual compensation for comparable officers at the peer companies may be the result of a year of over performance or under performance by the peer group; and (c) the Compensation Committee believes that ultimately the decision as to appropriate target compensation for a particular officer should be made based on the full review described above.

Irrelevant,The Committee believed that target bonus amounts for the NEOs for fiscal 2014 were consistent with our philosophy of linking pay to our performance and helped us reach our target annual total direct compensation of within the 50th to 75th percentile range relative to the peer group.
Irrelevant,"The Committee believed that the excise tax would negatively affect the incentive and retention value of long-term incentive equity awards, and in turn employee morale and retention, during a period of transition, uncertainty and tremendous effort in preparing for the consummation of the Business Combination."
Irrelevant,"The Committee believed that this could potentially have a negative effect on Applied’s retention efforts at a time when retention of our NEOs was of paramount importance, both to manage the business and drive toward a successful completion of the Business Combination and integration with Tokyo Electron."

Irrelevant,"The Committee believes that seeking to pay within this range furthers our goals of attracting, rewarding and retaining highly talented individuals, and motivating them to achieve goals that enhance stockholder value."

Irrelevant,The Committee believes that the vote indicates that most stockholders approve of the structure of executive compensation at Alaska Air Group.
Irrelevant,"The Committee believes that these results demonstrate the rigor of the targets adopted, that targets have been set at reasonable levels and that annual incentive compensation has been sensitive to Company performance."
Irrelevant,"The Committee believes that these results demonstrate the rigor of the targets adopted, that targets have been set at reasonable levels and that performance share award payouts have been sensitive to Company performance."
Irrelevant,The Committee believes that this approach balances the performance potential among the three elements of equity compensation and improves the deductibility of our LTI compensation with 2/3 of each named executive’s LTI opportunity tied to Company performance
Irrelevant,"The Committee believes that this dual-level performance framework appropriately emphasizes Company achievement of adjusted operating profit and adjusted EPS, which are important measures of operating and financial performance, while providing necessary flexibility to focus on the achievement of key business imperatives by individual NEOs."
Irrelevant,The Committee believes that this mix of short-term and long-term compensation allows it to achieve dual goals of attracting and retaining highly qualified executives and providing meaningful performance incentives for those executives.
Irrelevant,"The Committee believes that this program, emphasizing performance shares and options for our most senior employees, including all of our executive officers, reflects a focus on pay for performance and competitive considerations, and supports our business strategy."
Irrelevant,The Committee believes this balance of shared and personal goals is critical to an overall assessment of performance.
Irrelevant,The Committee carefully considers all of the factors influencing the results and the Senior Executive's performance impacting those results.
Irrelevant,The Committee chose to include the companies named above in its peer group for the following reasons:
Irrelevant,The Committee compares our executive compensation program with compensation paid by a peer group consisting of a broad range of high technology companies whose businesses are similar to ours and with which we typically compete for executive talent.

Irrelevant,"The Committee considered and provided input on performance goals and weightings initially proposed by management, which was incorporated into the final goals and weightings that subsequently were presented to, and approved by, the Committee."
Irrelevant,The Committee considers how each component of compensation motivates executives to help the Company achieve its performance goals and execute its strategic plan and how it promotes retention of executives who share the Company’s values.
Irrelevant,The Committee considers stock options and performance shares to be more strongly performance-related than RSUs.
Irrelevant,The Committee considers these requirements when designing compensation programs for NEOs.
Irrelevant,The Committee decided to phase out this perquisite allowance over a three-year period that began in 2014.
Irrelevant,"The Committee determined 2014 base salary adjustments based on an assessment of our 2013 results and each named executive officer’s position, performance, scope of responsibility, current salary level and market comparables."
Irrelevant,"The Committee determined that the awards would be cancelled without payout, based on the Company’s failure to meet threshold performance criteria during the performance period."
Irrelevant,The Committee determined that the compound annual growth rate in the Company’s income from continuing operations for the performance period was (4.8)% (4.7% if the Committee had not made the adjustments described above) and that the earnings multiple applicable to these awards during the performance period was 0% of target (decreased from 127% if the Committee had not made such adjustments).

Irrelevant,"The Committee determined these annual base salaries (generally effective as of April 1, 2014), annual cash incentive and equity compensation opportunities in the first quarter of 2014."
Irrelevant,The Committee determines the IPF rating for Mr. Splinter and Mr. Dickerson.
Irrelevant,"The Committee did not grant Mr. Splinter a long-term incentive award for fiscal 2015, as the Committee believed that the terms of Mr. Splinter’s retention agreement already provided sufficient incentive and retention value until his expected retirement at the end of March 2015."
Irrelevant,"The Committee did not increase or otherwise change NEO base salaries in fiscal 2014, except in recognition of the expanded responsibilities assumed by Mr. Salehpour, as further discussed below."
Irrelevant,"The Committee discusses the CEO’s proposed compensation with the Executive Chairman, and the Committee always makes final decisions regarding the CEO’s compensation when he is not present."
Irrelevant,"The Committee established a threshold level of ROIC required for the multiplier to apply, and the multiplier would be rounded down rather than apply at an amount beyond the first decimal point (e.g., if ROIC performance would extrapolate to a 1.27 multiplier, the multiplier would be rounded downward to 1.2)."
Irrelevant,The Committee establishes the Company’s general compensation philosophy.
Irrelevant,The Committee excluded several items from the Company’s results for purposes of calculating performance under the awards.
Irrelevant,"The Committee felt this balance was important particularly in a challenging year during which the NEOs would have to both drive Applied’s financial performance while devoting tremendous effort in managing the complexities of the Business Combination to close it, as well as in operating the combined businesses post-closing."
Irrelevant,The Committee further considers the results of the annual advisory “say-on-pay” vote and stockholder feedback.
Irrelevant,"The Committee generally sets, for both annual and long -term incentive compensation, performance goals with targets based on the Company’s operating plan and aligned with our strategy; non-financial goals generally are objective in nature."

Irrelevant,"The Committee is responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring adherence to the Company’s compensation philosophy."
Irrelevant,The Committee is responsible in its use of equity as long-term incentive compensation.
Irrelevant,"The Committee made the annual grant of stock options and performance-contingent restricted stock units at the Committee’s regularly scheduled meeting in December 2014, which aligns both the timing of equity grants with the setting of performance targets, and equity grant expensing with fiscal year planning."
Irrelevant,The Committee made these adjustments to exclude the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items that had a negative impact on 2013 income from continuing operations and to incent management to make decisions that are focused on long-term value creation.
Irrelevant,"The Committee made these adjustments, which totaled $.32 per share in the case of EPS from continuing operations, and $136 million in the case of operating income, to ensure that participants would not be rewarded for certain gains or penalized for having made decisions intended to foster long-term value creation, rationalize operations and allow for long-term reductions in cost."
Irrelevant,The Committee maintained target bonus opportunities at the same levels in place during 2013 for each of the named executive officers.

Irrelevant,The Committee recognized that leading the efforts to manage and close the Business Combination while simultaneously striving to meet Applied’s long-term financial and strategic goals would present singular challenges and be extremely demanding.
Irrelevant,"The Committee recognized that the fiscal 2014 cash-settled performance units did not allow our leadership team to participate in the stock price appreciation that they had helped to create for our stockholders in fiscal 2014, when there was an approximately 19% stock price appreciation during the fiscal year."
Irrelevant,The Committee recognizes that different types of equity compensation afford different benefits to the Company and the recipients.
Irrelevant,The Committee retains discretion to deviate from these metrics.
Irrelevant,The Committee retains discretion to further adjust the award downward or upward to appropriately reflect the performance assessment.
Irrelevant,The Committee retains discretion to reduce bonus amounts below the level that would otherwise be paid.

Irrelevant,The Committee reviews compliance with this requirement annually.
Irrelevant,The Committee reviews management’s recommendations regarding pay changes and awards and then approves or suggests changes to the proposal or may seek further analysis or background on the proposal.
Irrelevant,"The Committee seeks to ensure that the total compensation paid to our executive officers is fair, reasonable and competitive, provides an appropriate balance of base pay and short- and long-term incentives and does not cause unnecessary risk taking on the part of our executive officers."
Irrelevant,"The Committee selected these categories because the Committee desires to incent management to focus on the operating performance of the Company and these categories (1) reflect matters outside the control of participants which could create “windfall” benefits or undue penalties for participants (for example, changes in tax laws or accounting standards) or (2) accommodate the Committee’s concern not to inadvertently penalize participants for taking actions in the long-term interest of the Company and its stockholders (for example, a restructuring of operations) out of concern for the action’s impact on EPS from continuing operations or operating income."
Irrelevant,The Committee set the performance measures and the weights for each based on the relative importance of the goals.
Irrelevant,"The Committee sets the annual target bonus amount for Mr. Dickerson, and takes into consideration Mr. Dickerson’s recommendations in setting the annual target bonus amounts for the other NEOs."
Irrelevant,The Committee strives to meet these objectives while maintaining market-competitive pay levels and making efficient use of equity-based compensation.
Irrelevant,"The Committee strives whenever possible to structure its compensation plans such that they are tax-deductible, and it believes that a substantial portion of compensation paid under its current program (including the annual incentives, performance stock units and stock option grants described above) satisfies the requirements under Section 162(m)."
Irrelevant,"The Committee targeted a range within the 50th to the 75th percentile of Applied’s peer group for each of these NEOs’ total direct compensation, but not a particular point within the range."
Irrelevant,"The Committee then considers a combination of market data, corporate performance and individual performance ratings in evaluating base salary, annual bonus awards for the prior year, and bonus and equity targets for the current year, as described below."
Irrelevant,"The Committee then determines individual awards for each NEO, with consideration given to the CEO’s recommendations, as well as the size and value of other long-term incentive awards held by the NEO, the NEO’s job performance and contributions to Applied’s success, skill set, prior experience, time in his position, internal equity, pressures to attract and retain talent, market competitiveness, and business conditions and strategies."

Irrelevant,The Committee ultimately has the authority to approve management’s proposals for the executive officers.
Irrelevant,"The Committee uses both fixed compensation and variable performance-based compensation to achieve a program that is balanced, competitive and provides appropriate incentives."
Irrelevant,The Committee uses the tally sheets to verify that executive compensation is internally equitable and proportioned according to the Committee’s expectations.
Irrelevant,"The Committee uses these principles to determine base salaries, short-term cash incentives and long-term incentive awards."
Irrelevant,"The Committee, in consultation with management, decided that continuing base salary amounts from fiscal 2013 met the goal of sufficiently recognizing executives for their time and service, was sufficiently competitive to provide adequate retention value, and allowed Applied to continue its focus on weighting NEO cash compensation toward performance-based incentives."
Irrelevant,The Committee’s approach to annual incentive compensation generally has been:
Irrelevant,The Committee’s approach to performance share awards has been:
Irrelevant,The Committee’s decisions regarding 2014 CEO pay were reflective of the following:
Irrelevant,The Committee’s objective was to minimize the punitive impact of Section 4985 without undermining the objectives of Applied’s overall compensation program.

Irrelevant,"The Committee’s specific responsibilities are set forth in its charter, which may be found on the Company’s website at http://www.unitedrentals.com under “Corporate Governance” in the Investor Relations section."
Irrelevant,"The companies above met most of these criteria; in addition, certain of the companies were among Applied’s principal U.S. competitors or Applied’s top U.S. customers."

Irrelevant,This allowance has not been offered to new executives since fiscal year 2014 and was discontinued for all employees at the end of fiscal year 2015.
Irrelevant,This amendment applies to all equity granted after March 2011.

Irrelevant,"This approach enables us to attract and retain the level of qualified executive talent necessary to deliver sustained performance in a complex, global, medical device organization."
Irrelevant,This approach is summarized below.
Irrelevant,"This approach yielded six additions (Publix, TJX, Rite Aid, Staples, Dollar General, and Gap) and one removal (J.C. Penney) for a peer group of nineteen companies."
Irrelevant,"This avoids reducing the retention and incentive benefits, and avoids penalizing the NEOs for making the business and strategic decision to enter into the Business Combination."

Ring and Weiland, and for the portion of the annual bonus opportunity for Messrs. Holland, Beasley and Collins that was based on corporate performance measures."
Irrelevant,"This comparison demonstrates that the allocation of our compensation elements is similar to the compensation practices of our Reference Group, but with more weight to long-term incentives."
Irrelevant,"This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (‘‘CD&A’’) describes the compensation program for the following individuals, all of whom are considered Named Executive Officers (‘‘NEOs’’) for fiscal year 2015."
Irrelevant,"This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (“CD&A”) describes the principles and material elements of our executive compensation program, how we applied those principles in determining the material elements of our NEOs’ compensation for fiscal year 2014, and how we use our compensation program to drive performance."
Irrelevant,"This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) focuses on how our Named Executive Officers (NEOs) were compensated for fiscal 2014 (February 2, 2014 through January 31, 2015) and how their fiscal 2014 compensation aligns with our pay for performance philosophy."
Irrelevant,This Compensation Discussion and Analysis contains a more detailed discussion of each of the above components and the extent to which we analyzed market data in establishing each individual component in 2014.
Irrelevant,"This Compensation Discussion and Analysis, or “CD&A,” explains, for 2014, our executive compensation philosophy and objectives, each element of our executive compensation program and how the Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board made its compensation decisions for our 2014 named executive officers (“NEOs”) listed below:"
Irrelevant,"This component can only be earned if the Company achieves at least the threshold level of Coach, Inc. operating income established under the financial component."
Irrelevant,This contribution is made for those employees active on the last day of the calendar year and based on total pay received while participating during the calendar year.
Irrelevant,"This correction adds $30,477."
Irrelevant,"This correction was only reflected in the calculation of his December 31, 2014 accrued benefit so the increase is included in his 2014 change in pension value in the SERP."
Irrelevant,"This earned amount may increase to up to 300% of target based on achievement of a performance multiplier established for 2014, as described below."
Irrelevant,This earnings level equates to a CAGR of 6.7% from WEC’s 2011 earnings per share.
Irrelevant,"This error was discovered in 2015, and an additional 1,842 of 2014-2016 target units were awarded to Mr. Naughton in 2015."
Irrelevant,"This expanded role resulted from a new organizational structure implemented in August 2014 to better align the Company to our growth opportunities, increase focus on key areas of value creation, and pave the way for rapid integration with Tokyo Electron."
Irrelevant,"This followed three consecutive years in which the value of the equity awards for our named executive officers in each year was lower than it was the preceding year (except Mr. Rusckowski, who joined the Company in 2012 and whose 2013 equity award was the same as his 2012 equity award)."
Irrelevant,This investment plan included spending approximately $70 million in 2013 and again in 2014 on over 40 targeted projects that the Company believes provide opportunities for improved long-term revenue growth.
Irrelevant,This is a drop of approximately 3.6%.
Irrelevant,"This is accomplished with comprehensive performance metrics, such as:"
Irrelevant,This limitation does not apply to compensation that meets the tax code requirements for qualifying performance-based compensation.
Irrelevant,This means the Company is referring you to information that has previously been filed with the SEC and that this information should be considered as part of the filing you are reading.
Irrelevant,"This means there is a “double trigger” before severance benefits are paid; i.e., there must be both a change in control and a termination of employment."
Irrelevant,This mix consisted entirely of equity-based awards and 80% of the 2014 mix was performance-based as follows:
Irrelevant,This mix was designed to provide a balance of incentives to executives for creating long-term shareholder value through strong financial and operating performance and to align executive interests with shareholder interests.
Irrelevant,This new ‘‘performance curve’’ required a higher level of incremental performance to earn the prior 133% maximum payout and a significantly higher level of incremental performance to earn the new 200% maximum payout.
Irrelevant,This objective has been achieved in previous years through grants of equity awards that were subject to both performance goals and additional time-based vesting requirements.
Irrelevant,This outcome confirmed the Company’s view that the NEO compensation program is performance-based and aligns with our stockholders’ interests.
Irrelevant,This outcome demonstrates the Company’s pay for performance philosophy since generally the NEOs will only realize the grant date fair value if the share price appreciates subsequent to the grant date.
Irrelevant,"This outcome is based on our 13-company retail peer group at the time of that grant: Amazon.com, Best Buy, Costco, CVS Caremark, Home Depot, J.C. Penney, Kohl’s, Kroger, Lowe’s, Macy’s, Sears, Walgreens and Walmart."
Irrelevant,"This partial acceleration of vesting helps to mitigate some, but not all, of the 15% excise tax impact on our NEOs."
Irrelevant,"This payment does not increase the benefit of the awards to the NEOs, but is simply intended to place them in the same position as if there were no punitive excise tax."
Irrelevant,"This peer group was chosen because we believe these companies are similar to WEC in terms of business model and long-term strategies, with a focus on regulated utility operations rather than a non-regulated business model."
Irrelevant,"This performance unit award paid out at 97.5% of the target cash value based on our actual EBITDA less CapEx result of $8.0B, which was 99.4% of the target EBITDA less CapEx goal of $8.1B as detailed in the following table."
Irrelevant,"This policy applied to all previously issued stock options and to options issued in the future, if any."
Irrelevant,This policy applies to any performance-based annual or long-term incentives awarded to our Named Executive Officers as well as other key executives.
Irrelevant,"This policy formalizes WEC’s practice since the beginning of 2006 to not include any provisions requiring a gross-up for excise tax in any new executive employment agreement, as well as the Compensation Committee’s policy since July 2011 to eliminate tax gross-ups on perquisites provided by the Company to its officers (except to officers who were already receiving gross-ups as of July 2011)."
Irrelevant,"This policy is in addition to any requirements which might be imposed pursuant to Section 304 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and will be modified to the extent required by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and the related final rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission."
Irrelevant,This positioning is primarily related to organizational changes over recent years where Senior Executives in new positions have received long term incentive compensation below the 75th percentile.
Irrelevant,"This practice allows for differentiation based on time in the position, scope of responsibilities, and individual performance."
Irrelevant,This procedure is consistent with prior practices.
Irrelevant,This provision disallows the deductibility of certain compensation to our Named Executive Officers in excess of $1 million per year unless it is considered performance-based compensation under the Code.
Irrelevant,This report is submitted by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
Irrelevant,"This report may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management’s current expectations, the accuracy of which is necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties."
Irrelevant,This represented 225% of his annual base salary.
Irrelevant,This represents a 3.1% increase over Mr. Klappa’s 2013 base salary.
Irrelevant,"This results in a balanced portfolio of compensation rewards consisting of, for the CEO, 50% performance share awards (to reward relative performance), 20% stock options (to reward absolute share price appreciation) and 30% time-based restricted shares (to promote retention), as shown below."
Irrelevant,This review included consideration of the following specific elements of the Company’s executive compensation policies and procedures:
Irrelevant,This section describes performance-based compensation for 2014.
Irrelevant,"This section describes the compensation program for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2014, as well as the compensation program for each of the Company’s other three most highly compensated executive officers serving at the end of the year."
Irrelevant,"This severance amount is the same as that which had been provided for Mr. Splinter while he was CEO from 2003 to 2013, and would be subject to Mr. Dickerson’s agreeing to a release of claims and non-solicitation and non-disparagement provisions in favor of Applied."
Irrelevant,"This structure essentially places the decision of whether or not to trigger change of control benefits largely in the hands of the acquiring company, since a change of control alone would not trigger the benefit."
Irrelevant,"This system provides a foundation for day-to-day management, including best-in-class business performance tools, and will help us to develop the capabilities that we need to manage the Company more effectively."
Irrelevant,"This table differs from the Summary Compensation Table provided on page 38, which includes several items that are driven by accounting and actuarial assumptions that are not necessarily reflective of the compensation actually realized by the executive in a particular year."
Irrelevant,This table summarizes the compensation for 2014 for each of our named executive officers.
Irrelevant,This target level of compensation is expressed as a percentage of base salary.
Irrelevant,"This value was based on the volume weighted price of WEC’s common stock for the ten trading days beginning on December 2, 2013 and ending on December 13, 2013."
Irrelevant,This vesting acceleration is conditioned upon the closing of the Business Combination and will apply only if the NEO is expected to be a “disqualified individual” and subject to a 15% excise tax under Section 4985 on such equity awards.
Irrelevant,"This vote is advisory, which means that the vote to approve the Company’s executive compensation is not binding on the Company, our Board or the HR Committee of the Board."
Irrelevant,This was a change in practice from fiscal 2014 when we used the average price from the month prior to the grant date to calculate the number of units.
Irrelevant,This was made possible by managing the business more efficiently and delivering on our strategy of converting innovations into earnings through new technologies that provide value to customers and competitive differentiations for the Company.
Irrelevant,"This year, as previously indicated, Mr. Rainer joined the company as President and Chief Operating Officer in September 2014, relocating from Chicago to New York; Mr. Cohen returned from a part-time consulting role to become Chief of Staff to Mr. Luis in September 2014; he was promoted to President, North America and appointed an executive officer in January 2015, relocating from Hong Kong to New York; Mr. Bickley, President, International Group, was appointed an executive officer in January 2015."

Irrelevant,Those members of the Board of Directors who would qualify for service on the Compensation Committee review and ratify these awards at the Board’s regularly scheduled February meeting.
Irrelevant,Those who fail to comply with the policy in the required timeframe may sell only 50% of the after-tax shares received from stock option exercises or the vesting of RSUs and PRSUs until compliance with the stock ownership policy is achieved.
Irrelevant,Three New Financial Partnerships
Irrelevant,Three of these metrics related to Total Stockholder Return (“TSR”) (the “TSR Performance Metrics”):
Irrelevant,Three year average net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) divided by average invested capital for both our results and our retail peer group excluding discontinued operations.
Irrelevant,"Three years ago, we embarked on a journey to transform our business."

Irrelevant,Three-year high in both non-GAAP adjusted operating profit margin and non-GAAP adjusted net income
Irrelevant,Three-yearperformance period
Irrelevant,Threshold
Irrelevant,THRESHOLD ACHIEVED
Irrelevant,"Threshold achievement earns 25% of target, achievement at goal earns 100% of target, and stretch achievement earns 200% of target."
Irrelevant,Threshold performance on this metric occurs for performance at 75% of target at which time 0% of the units vest.
Irrelevant,"Threshold, target and maximum were adjusted upwards during the performance period to the levels shown to account for our acquisition of the assets of National Pump & Compressor, Ltd., Canadian Pump & Compressor Ltd., GulfCo Industrial Equipment, LP and LD Services, LLC."
Irrelevant,Through fiscal year 2015 some executives received a transportation allowance.
Irrelevant,"Throughout this Proxy Statement, the term ""Named Executive Officers"" means: (1) the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Anderson; (2) the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Peter B. Oleksiak; (3) the President and Chief Operating Officer, Steven E. Kurmas; (4) the Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer, David E. Meador; and (5) the Group President of our Company, and the President and Chief Operating Officer of DTE Electric and Gas Storage and Pipelines, Gerardo Norcia."
Irrelevant,"Thus, the actual compensation realized by an NEO will be commensurate with our actual performance."
Irrelevant,"Thus, the awards vest in connection with a change in control only if the executive’s employment is actually or constructively terminated within two years after a change in control."
Irrelevant,"Thus, the Named Executive Officers will realize value from their stock options only to the degree that Alaska Air Group’s stockholders realize value, provided the stockholder had purchased shares and held them for the same period as the executive."
Irrelevant,"Thus, the peer group now consists of the following 16 companies, which are generally in the healthcare services, equipment and distribution industries."
Irrelevant,"Thus, the total payout for this award for the NEOs, with the exception of Messrs. O’Flynn and Da Santos who did not receive this award, was 48.7% of the original target number of shares as detailed in the following table:"
Irrelevant,"Thus, while the Committee has considered peer group data as described above, it has also applied other compensation principles, most notably internal equity, when determining executive compensation."
Irrelevant,Tie annual incentive compensation to key operating goals;
Irrelevant,"Tied the earnout of the cash-based performance units to an absolute operating profit margin threshold rather than a scaled relative operating profit margin (recognizing the difficulty of setting appropriate relative performance ranges while preparing to close the Business Combination), and further required continued employment over a three-year period; and"

Irrelevant,"While goals are set for each measure below, the Compensation Committee approves the score based on its qualitative assessment."
Irrelevant,"While in previous years the Company’s total shareholder return was measured relative to two peer groups (a custom peer group and the Philadelphia Utility Index), the Compensation Committee decided to streamline the performance share peer group for the 2014 grant by eliminating the Philadelphia Utility Index and establishing one custom peer group."
Irrelevant,"While targets when set are considered achievable, a superior level of performance is required to receive an award above the target level."
Irrelevant,"While the AICP rewards Senior Executives for the achievement of specific formulaic financial measures, the Compensation Committee utilizes a performance scorecard to reward Senior Executives based upon the Compensation Committee's assessment of the achievement of specific performance goals that are critical to the execution of the Company's strategy, but may or may not be formulaic in nature."
Irrelevant,"While the Committee attempts to base compensation decisions on the most recent market data available, it also recognizes the importance of flexibility, and may go above or below the market median for any individual or for any specific element of compensation."
Irrelevant,"While the Committee does not use a specific formula to determine the allocation between performance-based and fixed compensation, it does review the total compensation and competitive benchmarking when determining such allocation."
Irrelevant,"While the Committee had a favorable view of Management’s performance in light of these circumstances, the Committee nevertheless noted that the Company’s financial results were at the middle or lower end of the Company’s estimates, which had a significant impact on Annual Incentive Payments as compared to the target award and the prior year award for each Named Executive."
Irrelevant,"While the Compensation Committee generally intends to structure and administer our stockholder-approved compensation plans so as not to be subject to the deduction limit of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Compensation Committee may, where it believes it is in the best interests of our stockholders and to remain competitive in the marketplace for talent, approve awards or payments that cannot be deducted in order to maintain flexibility in structuring appropriate compensation programs."
Irrelevant,"While the executive officers are given five years to meet the applicable stock ownership guidelines, the Compensation Committee monitors participation and expects that incremental progress will be made each year by each executive officer who has not met the applicable guidelines."
Irrelevant,"While the measures for evaluating the Senior Executives' performance with respect to the performance goals are subject to the Compensation Committee's discretion, the Compensation Committee and the Company establish performance scorecard goals and specific expectations related to the achievement of these goals at the beginning of each year."
Irrelevant,"While the programs and pay levels reflect differences in job responsibilities, the structure of the compensation and benefits program is applied consistently to our Named Executive Officers, including the CEO."
Irrelevant,"While the RNC is mindful of the benefit to the Company of the full deductibility of compensation, the committee believes that the requirements of Section 162(m) should not impair its flexibility in compensating our NEOs in a manner that can best promote the Company’s objectives."
Irrelevant,"While the Say on Pay votes are advisory and not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee strongly values the opinions of the stockholders as expressed in the Say on Pay votes."
Irrelevant,"While the secondary performance goals are shared by all NEOs, the IPF is based on performance against personal objectives established at the beginning of the year for NEOs other than Mr. Dickerson and Mr. Splinter."
Irrelevant,"While the secondary performance goals were the same for all NEOs, the weightings of certain goals varied among the NEOs to reflect their influence over both Applied’s overall performance and their individual business units and functions."
Irrelevant,"While there is no direct link to performance once an executive officer becomes a participant, the annual accrual is based on the executive officer’s position as well as the current year’s base salary and bonus payments, which are directly linked to performance, as discussed above."

Irrelevant,"With a significant portion of the executive officer’s annual grant LTI mix (75% PSUs/25% PBRSUs) contingent on relative performance versus the retail peer group, a focus of this year’s annual review was to broaden the view of the competitive landscape in assessing relative performance under the PSU and PBRSU plans, as well as assessing the executive officer’s compensation levels."

Irrelevant,"With respect to PSU awards that were granted in March 2012 for the three-year performance period ended January 31, 2015, our NEOs would have earned 41.5% of the goal number of shares if the 162(m) threshold had been met."
Irrelevant,"With respect to the 2014 performance units, the amount of the benefit that ultimately vests will be dependent upon the Company’s total stockholder return over a three-year period ending December 31, 2016, as compared to the total stockholder return of the custom peer group previously described under “Competitive Benchmarking,” again excluding TEG and Pepco Holdings."

Irrelevant,"With the data breach more than a year behind us and the difficult decision to discontinue our Canadian operations made, our team is focused and aligned on the following five key priorities to transform our business for long-term growth, which were announced in early March 2015:"
