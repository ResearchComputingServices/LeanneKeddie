2% when adjusted for divestitures and currency  GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.82, up from $1.34 in the prior year and below the previously provided investor guidance of $2.09 to $2.14 per share  Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.92, up 4% from adjusted non- GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the prior year and within the previously provided investor guidance of $1.90 to $1.95 per share  Cash flow from operations of $5.0 billion, up 27% from adjusted cash flow from operations in the prior year  Returned $3.0 billion to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, and delivered in excess of 45% total stockholder return since our November 1, 2015 launch    Annual Incentive payout for corporate Named Executive Officers (\"NEOs\"), including the CEO, was between 96% and 115% of target, and between 73% and 127% of target for Business Leader NEOs  Long-term Incentive payout in the form of Performance Adjusted Restricted Stock Units (\"PARSUs\") was

expected to deliver HPE stockholders approximately $8.8 billion, including 50.1% ownership of the new combined company  The transaction creates two businesses that are stronger, more focused and better able to innovate and adapt in today's market, delivering faster outcomes to our customers    To account for the removal of budgeted H3C financial performance after the completion of its divestiture from HPE, annual and long-term incentive performance goals were adjusted in a precise and formulaic manner according to the pre- determined adjustment guidelines set at the beginning of the performance period  In response to the significant ES/CSC spin-merge transaction, certain equity award modifications were implemented in a cost-efficient manner to strengthen existing employee retention incentives over the essential time period for the transaction, and to acknowledge that some of the original performance goals, such as two- and three-year ROIC and RTSR goals, were no longer
